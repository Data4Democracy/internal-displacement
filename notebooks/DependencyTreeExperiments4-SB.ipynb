    "**Overview:**\n",
    " - Refactor some of the work from @jlln DependencyTreeExperiments3, in particular DependencyTreeExperiments3\n",
    " - Replace some of the loops with separate functions for processing Articles, Sentences and Sentence Branches\n",
    " - While processing a particular article, keep track of the most recent place names and locations found which can then be used as default values for future reports\n",
    " - Extend the search for reporting units over all children of the reporting term\n",
    " - Make no assumptions about whether the numerical term is a child or parent of the reporting unit (there are examples of both\n",
    " \n",
    "**Testing:**\n",
    "- Evaluate any performance gains by counting the number of articles for which 0 stories are encountered in the training set\n",
    "- Prior to refactoring, 137 of 291 articles returned 0 stories\n",
    "- After refactoring, 82 of 291 articles returned 0 stories\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future work**\n",
    " - In addition to work already identified by @jlln, need to evaluate the accuracy of each story identified with this new approach\n",
    " - In some cases the linkages between reporting terms and reporting units are too broad, for exampling associating 'houses' with being 'killed'\n",
    " - Need to evaluate whether parse tree dependency labels need to be take into account"

      "Flash flooding across Afghanistan and Pakistan has left more than 160 dead and dozens stranded in one of South Asia's worst natural disasters this year, say officials.  The flooding, caused by unusually heavy rain, has left villagers stuck in remote areas without shelter, food or power.  Mountainous Afghanistan was the worst hit, with 61 people killed and approximately 500 traditional mud-brick homes washed away in more than a dozen villages in Sarobi, a rural district less than an hour from Kabul, officials said.  Floods left a village devastated in the remote eastern Afghan province of Nuristan. At least 60 homes were destroyed across three districts, said provincial spokesman Mohammad Yusufi. No one was killed.  Authorities have been unable to deliver aid to some badly affected villages by land as roads in the area are controlled by the Taliban, Yusufi added.  “We have asked the national government for help as have an overwhelming number of locals asking for assistance, but this is a Taliban-ridden area,” Yusufi said.  At least 24 people were also died in two other eastern border provinces, Khost and Nangarhar, according to local officials. More than fifty homes and shops were destroyed and thousands of acres of farmland flooded.  In Pakistan monsoon rains claimed more than 80 lives, local media reported. Houses collapsing, drowning and electrocution all pushed up the death toll, said Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon.  In Karachi, the commercial capital and a southern port city that is home to 18 million people, poor neighborhoods were submerged waist-deep in water and many precincts suffered long power outages. Deaths were also reported in the north and west of the country.\n",

      "The debris of collapsed houses is pictured in El Galpón, Salta province, yesterday. A magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck northwest Argentina, the US Geological Survey reported, leaving at least one person dead and damaging homes. Salta Governor Juan Manuel Urtubey visited the town and promised repair works.  A magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck Salta province yesterday, killing one woman, injuring at least 30 people and extensively damaging the town of El Galpón.  The earthquake hit the town of El Galpón, which is roughly 170 kilometres by road from the provincial capital and 50 kilometres from the epicentre of the earthquake, at 8:33 in the morning yesterday, causing roofs to collapse. Ninety-four-year-old Alberta Flores was killed by a falling beam while she slept. Local doctors reported that 30 others were treated for minor cut and scrapes.  Salta Governor Juan Manuel Urtubey rushed to the town, promising to help reconstruct damaged homes and buildings and confirming that 15 families have been evacuated to the town hall as a precaution against collapse. Urtubey and his Cabinet made the trip to a town where 7,000 residents live after Mayor Héctor Romero appealed for assistance on local radio.  “We don’t have water, the power is out, what we are living through is terrible,” said Romero to the Cadena 3 radio station.  “I was at home and I felt a strong movement and noise, I got my kids out of the house — which also suffered damage to the roof — I went outside and saw that the school had been destroyed. Thank God this was on a Saturday because if not, it would have taken all of the kids.”  Urtubey has ordered that a damage assessment be carried out so that works can start tomorrow. He also said that even though the situation was under control, the province’s medical helicopter was available for the residents of El Galpón if necessary.  In addition to the multiple brick buildings that came down as a result of the tremor, there were reports of damage to the local hospital. Images and video from the town featured bricks scattered across the pavement and shattered walls teetering perilously.  The 5.9 quake lasted for approximately 15 seconds and was reported to have taken place 10 kilometres underground and was felt in neighbouring provinces such as Jujuy, Tucumán, Catamarca, Santiago del Estero and even parts of Chaco province according to the DyN news agency.  Northern Argentina commonly experiences low-intensity earthquakes but yesterday’s was the third this calendar year in Salta with an intensity of at least 5 on the Richter scale.  Argentina’s most destructive earthquake dates back to 1944, killing 10,000 people in the province of San Juan and wiped out large sections of the provincial capital.\n",

Storms lashed towns around Wangaratta and Bright from 6pm on Tuesday, causing flash flooding and bringing golf ball-sized hail to the area.  A woman had to be rescued when her weatherboard home in the small town of Ovens, north of Bright, was washed away.  Mud and debris from the landslip inundated a section of the Great Alpine Road, forcing the closure of one lane.  The woman escaped serious injury, a police spokeswoman said.  At Moyhu, near Wangaratta, a burst of heavy rain caused flash flooding and brought down trees.  The State Emergency Service received more than 100 calls for help as more than 50 millimetres of rain fell in the area in an hour.  The storms brought down more than 70 trees in the area, damaging 14 buildings, an SES spokeswoman said. Four homes were flooded.  The heaviest rainfall was recorded at Carboor​ Upper, where 94.6 millimetres fell in two hours.  It was fortunate the storms developed just east of Melbourne, Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Scott Williams said.  \"It would have been mayhem on our roads if that rain had fallen here,\" he said.  Mr Williams said Wednesday and Thursday would be fine and sunny, ahead of a cooler spell on Friday and Saturday.

      "Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warned the storm remained \"very serious\" and urged the public in affected areas to remain indoors amid the threat of flooding and high winds, which have brought down trees and caused some damage to homes.  During a press conference, she said the storm system was now moving south along the coast from the town of Yeppoon towards Rockhampton, which lies 595 kilometers (370 miles) north of Brisbane, the state capital.  Around 33,000 households in the area are now without power, she said, warning that this number was likely to grow as the day progresses.  \"It is still a dangerous cyclone. We are heartened that it has reduced from a (Category) five to a four, but ... it is heading towards Rockhampton, a heavily populated regional town in Queensland, and we want everyone to be safe. So stay in doors,\" Palaszczuk said.  Queensland's Bureau of Meteorology said the Yeppoon area, where some 800 people were forced into temporary shelters, had seen the most \"destructive winds\" after the storm made landfall at around 8 a.m. Friday (5 p.m. ET Thursday). But it said the winds would weaken further by the time it reached Rockhampton -- though Category 3 winds in excess of 100 kph (62 mph) were still destructive. #CycloneMarcia now Category 4.

      "The number of homes destroyed in the Wye River fire on Victoria’s Great Ocean Road on Christmas Day has risen to 116.  Country Fire Authority deputy incident controller Mark Gunning said 116 houses in Wye River and Separation Creek had been destroyed in the 2200-hectare blaze.  “That will probably be the final number, as we’ve just completed an extensive search,” Gunning said on Saturday evening.  The fire swept through bushland and began to advance toward the town of Lorne on Friday night.    And the emergency management commissioner, Craig Lapsley, said the blaze could continue burning until January or February. Even a dousing of rain on Saturday was unlikely to do much in the long term once the state began to dry out. “This fire doesn’t go away,” Lapsley said.  More than 300 firefighters spent the night fighting the fire after the town of Lorne was evacuated on Friday evening. Residents were told they could go home after an evacuation recommendation was lifted shortly after 9am on Saturday.  The nearby townships of Wye River, Separation Creek, Kennett River and Grey River were evacuated earlier on Friday afternoon. Emergency warnings remain in place for Wye River and Separation Creek, and both areas remained closed on Saturday afternoon.  “Power is out, though fallen domestic solar power lines remain a threat,” a Country Fire Authority notice said.    “There are a number of hazardous tress that have been burnt and are dangerous, and damage to septic systems can result in leaking sewerage and health hazards.”    Crews were also assessing the full extent of property damage in area.    Watch and act alerts were in place for Lorne, Allenvale, Kennett River and Grey River on Saturday.  Lapsley said on Saturday morning: “Obviously we are very pleased to see the emergency warning lifted for Lorne, and that means VicRoads and VicPol can now go about restoring roads so people can access all the way down the coast to Lorne.    “However, the roads from Lorne south will be closed for days until VicRoads and others, local government, do their assessments of the roads to ensure they are safe and until they are safe people won’t be able to access that area.  “Those people in Wye River and Separation Creek that have lost properties, we’ll do our best in the next 24 hours to get those people back in to have a look at the damage, the impact and destruction that this fire has caused.”  Lapsley said strong local winds on Friday had blown embers over control lines – something that had only been expected to happen on a much hotter, windier day – but the response was well planned.  “That plan played out. It was actioned just before lunchtime on Christmas Day where the community were told to evacuate. And they did that in a very orderly way.  “We always say that primacy of life is the critical issue in the state particularly after the royal commission [into the] fires of 2009. That’s the direct result of why we haven’t lost life for what is a very intense fire yesterday … [people] walked away from the fire that had every potential to be a killer.”  Daniel Andrews, the state premier, said Victorians were “opening up their homes” and assisting people who had “not had a very good Christmas at all – people who are out of their homes, out of their areas and doing it tough at the moment. The very best comes out at the very worst of times.    “This is really a very challenging fire – but in the planning and the execution and indeed in terms of the outcomes, no person has been harmed. That’s something that we can be very proud of.  “It will be a very difficult few days, though, indeed many weeks, for those who have lost their homes, or at least have lost a premises. I can confirm that 35 houses are gone in Wye River, 18 are gone in Separation Creek. And the fire stopped just some 500 metres short of Kennett River. There would have been several more losses if it had kept going.”  Weather over the next few days has been predicted to be favourable for firefighting, with rain and lower temperatures.  The main firefront had not gone through Kennett River, but firefighters defending homes there had put out spot fires and no properties had been reported burnt.  Holidaymakers were being advised on Saturday to stay away, and those away from their homes were told not to return yet.  The Great Ocean Road remained closed from Bellbrae to Skenes Creek on Saturday morning but was reopened between Torquay and Lorne.  Community meetings were due to be held at lunchtime on Saturday at relief centres in Apollo Bay and Torquay.  Organisers of the Falls music festival, due to be held near Lorne from Monday, were due to meet fire authorities at noon on Saturday to discuss whether it could go ahead.    “The township of Lorne is now being evacuated, the Falls farm itself is safe from the path of the fires,” a statement on festival’s website said.    “We are working with the CFA, fire authorities and emergency services to stay across the current situation.”    The festival is scheduled to begin on Monday and run until New Year’s Day.  The Bureau of Meteorology predicted a top of 18C at Lorne on Boxing Day and up to 20mm of rain.\n",

      "PRAGUE—Thousands were forced from their homes and at least 10 people were killed as floodwaters deluged swathes of Europe on Monday, including the historic center of the Czech capital Prague.  Shops and schools were shut and road and rail transports were disrupted across the Czech Republic, Austria and Germany following torrential rains.  The flooding caused chaos at Prague Zoo where around 1,000 animals were moved to higher ground after the Vltava river burst its banks late Sunday.  Zookeepers had to tranquilize tigers and other large animals in a dramatic overnight operation.  “It’s a terrifying feeling to experience this all over again,” Petr Velensky, the zoo’s reptile specialist, told AFP, recalling how many animals drowned in a 2002 flood.  Czech rescue crews were searching for four more people believed to have died in floodwaters that cut power to tens of thousands of households.  The heavy rainfall has triggered nightmarish memories of the 2002 floods that killed dozens in the region including 17 in the Czech Republic alone.  The Czech government declared a state of emergency Sunday, deploying 2,000 troops in its rescue drive as more than 8,000 people were evacuated from their homes, officials said.  A house collapse claimed two lives south of Prague, while an electrician was killed trying to switch off a transformer as a precaution, a woman perished when she was hit by a falling tree branch and three men drowned in rivers or drains around the country, police said.  “You realize here what nature can do. How helpless we really are despite having all our technology,” Prague pensioner Helena Holubova said, watching the water rise from a bridge over the Vltava in central Prague.  With Prague’s 14th-century Charles Bridge under threat, a 25-ton excavator was at work throughout the day Monday to remove debris piling up around the structure.  Nikol Voborilova, a worker at a riverside restaurant in Prague, told AFP: “We are closed for now, we’ve moved the equipment out and we have 30-40 centimeters (12 to 16 inches) of water inside.”  The river was expected to peak in the capital on Tuesday.  Thousands of households were hit with power outages, while fallen trees snarled rail traffic across western regions of the Czech Republic, where chemical plants were also shut down as a precaution to prevent dangerous spills seen in 2002.  Flooding also deluged neighboring Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Two people were reported dead in Austria and another person died in Switzerland.  “We’re in shock. We had to leave home in the blink of an eye,” a woman in the eastern German city of Dresden which had been severely damaged in 2002 told the NTV channel.  She and her baby spent the night at a community center, like thousands of others evacuated in the eastern region of Saxony, where rescue efforts by police and soldiers were being hampered by power outages.  Some 2,500 people were evacuated from hard-hit Grimma, near Leipzig.  Two people were reported missing in Germany.  In Austria, two people were killed in flooding and close to 1,000 were evacuated as landslides threatened their homes, mostly around the western city of Salzburg and in the north.  Authorities in Austria warned that the Danube and the Inn rivers could surpass levels from 2002, when the country suffered up to 7.5 billion euros ($9.8 billion) in damage.  Water levels on the Danube, Inn and Ilz rivers, which meet in the German city of Passau, have already surpassed records from 2002 and 1954.  “A lot of people who already had to cope with major flooding in 2002 are refusing to leave their homes,” Passau mayor Juergen Duppen told Germany’s N24 TV channel.—Jan Flemr\n",

      "PRIME Minister Perry Christie said yesterday the government plans to simultaneously rebuild the hurricane-ravaged Family Islands where an estimated 836 homes were completely destroyed.  Mr Christie said based on information from the Department of Social Services, Hurricane Joaquin wiped out 413 homes in Long Island, 227 houses in San Salvador, 123 homes in Acklins, 50 houses in Crooked Island and 23 residences in Rum Cay.  However, Mr Christie suggested that the numbers could increase as teams continue to assess the damage to homes and provide assistance to impacted and displaced families.  Last week, the nation’s leader said an initial estimate of the costs of damage due to Hurricane Joaquin was already at $60m and was expected to rise as the additional assessments came into the Ministry of Finance.  While he has stated the government will most likely borrow money to assist with rebuilding, he revealed yesterday that the government has received grants to assist with the effort. The most recent grant was $1.7m from the Japanese government through its Japanese Aid Programme.  The prime minister yesterday spoke about this matter in the House of Assembly and the progress made on the southern and central islands since the passage of the category four storm earlier this month.  “This is a continuing exercise,” Mr Christie said, “and based on their (the assessors) findings, the government will respond in kind as a part of the work of the National Restoration and Recovery Unit. This will be done in the shortest possible time as the primary consideration of my government is to house and restore the physical comforts of our citizens.”  He continued: “Mr Speaker, I have met personally with the leaders of these teams, the engineers from the Ministry of Works and all the technical people of the government with the view to indicating that the intention of the government, Mr Speaker, which is to restore these matters in the shortest possible time and that we want to have a comprehensive approach to restoration, not one island at a time, but all islands at the same time.  “So, Mr Speaker, I expect as these teams come in that works will commence, in fact work has already commenced on some islands.”  The Department of Housing, he said, has provided designs of houses constructed following previous hurricanes, however, the foundation designs have to be adjusted to account for higher flood levels experienced during Hurricane Joaquin. Local contractors will be given the opportunity to construct the homes in the various Family Islands.  Mr Christie said as the efforts begin, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has purchased five “homes on wheels” that can each accommodate three adults or two adults and two children. Additionally seven mobile trailer homes were procured that are able to accommodate six to 10 persons.  The temporary units will be assigned to families and government employees on the affected islands who have been displaced due to the destruction of their homes or rental units while the construction of permanent replacements are completed.  Immediately after the passage of Hurricane Joaquin, BTC discovered that 59 of its cell sites were off line that negatively affected 59 communities in the central and southern islands.  However, over the last two weeks, BTC has been able to restore services to all islands except south Long Island where two cell sites are down in the settlements of Roses and Mortimer’s. This is due to downed poles that are hindering the restoration of normal services, Mr Christie said.  He said at the moment there are no fixed Internet services to the south of Clarence Town, but work is continuing.  In Acklins, all sites are still down and dishes have been destroyed. Mr Christie said in Lovely Bay residents are able to make cellular calls using the site at Crooked Island. Also in Long Cay the dish on the cell tower needs to be re-aligned.  The Department of Civil Aviation, Mr Christie said, has confirmed that all airports in the islands affected by Hurricane Joaquin are open for normal operations, although some terminal buildings suffered damage.  The last to be re-opened was Deadman’s Cay Airport in Long Island, which was opened for service on October 9.  He said the Department of Civil Aviation is continuing to carry out assessments on the conditions of the airports in the affected areas with a view towards any immediate remediation that may be necessary.  In the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, Mr Christie said the Department of Social Services deployed four teams consisting of 14 social workers to conduct rapid initial damage assessments and assist with distribution of food and water to the severely affected islands.  The team deployed to Rum Cay conducted assessments on 29 homes, but were unable to process any of the winter residents whose homes may have been affected. He said the social workers are still compiling data on the number of residents by gender – this includes 10 school age children.  In San Salvador the team assessed 216 homes and counted 62 unoccupied homes. There are 227 students on the island, however, five have relocated to the capital.  During assessments in Crooked Island, the department processed 25 homes. Sixteen people remain in the clinic, as their homes are inhabitable.  There are seven homes remaining in Long Cay, which had 24 persons.  Mr Christie said long-term accommodations need to be identified for them along with the other residents whose homes were destroyed or severely damaged.  In Acklins, social workers completed 107 assessments. This does not include the persons whose homes were destroyed. They are in the process of compiling their data.  A team was deployed for Long Island on October 5. The team reported that the island was severely damaged which resulted in many homes being destroyed.  Mr Christie said it was difficult for the social workers to obtain an accurate count of all the families and homes that were affected by Hurricane Joaquin. However, they continue to process and compile information on the number of men, women and children affected.  Mr Christie said with respect to the restoration and recovery of vital state owned infrastructure, the Ministry of Works and its Urban Planning Department has completed its initial survey of damage, including roads, causeways and bridges and other government installations, including schools, clinics, and official residences.  He said he was in the process of analysing this report to decide on further action.  Staff from the Ministry of Housing are currently reviewing the assessments and compiling lists of building materials required for repairs in the affected islands.  Mr Christie said NEMA is also sourcing building materials which will be shipped to the Family Islands to be distributed to persons who have requested and qualified for assistance with building materials only or for building materials and labour.  The Royal Bahamas Defence Force will assist with some of the smaller repairs and NEMA is compiling a list of contractors and skilled construction craftsmen in the various Family Islands who will be able to assist with labour for repairs.  The technical staff of the Disaster Recovery and Reconstruction Unit with the help of other government agencies is compiling the list of homes that will have to be constructed to accommodate those persons whose homes were destroyed and have no source of permanent shelter.  Mr Christie said it is expected that there will be a close liaison between all of these engineering teams to ensure that there is no overlapping and more importantly that nothing falls between the cracks.\n",

      "Two people have died and about 250  were left homeless after a storm hit Bobonong on November 19.  In an interview, Bobonong police station commander, Superintendent Paul Seoko,  said a seven-year old child died when a wall collapsed on him while a  69-year-old woman died due to a shock.  Supt Seoko said the storm started just after midnight but worsened after 1am when winds became stronger and aggressive.  He said it was difficult for people to report cases of damage  due to lack of communication saying many came after water had subsided in the morning. He said the most affected locations were Rasetimela, Mabumahibidu and Borotsi wards.  Supt Seoko said the storm destroyed power lines and he therefore cautioned people not to come into contact with electric cables. He said they were working round the clock together with the office of the district officer through the district disaster committee to assist the victimes.  Teachers’ quarters in Matshekge, kitchen roof and Borotsi Primary School and Mafetsakgang schools were also blown away.  One resident Mr Moipolai Moipolai of Borotsi ward said \"it was my first time to see this storm. I did not sleep, our house was destroyed.\"  Another resident Mr Othusitse Robert said everything in his house was soaked.\"Furniture, electrical appliances were destroyed and as you can see we are homeless,\" he  said..  Reports from the district disaster management committee stated that five teams were dispatched to assess the situation and over 241 household, eight businesses and 39 government houses were affected.  The report showed that a total of 125 people were assessed in Rasetimela with 37 eligible for assistance, 88 in that ward were eligible for food only .  In Borotsi 23 people were assed,  16 people were eligible for food, while five were eligble for shelter and in Mabumahibudu 71 people were assessed, with 57 eligible for food only  and nine will need shelter.

      "At least 41 people have died in floods that have swept through the country's southeast in recent weeks.  At least 41 people have died and nearly 70,000 have been left homeless following torrential rain in southeast Brazil over the past few weeks, officials have said.  In Espirito Santo state, Civil Defence officials on Thursday reported a total of 27 fatalities, including eight on Thursday, in what they described as the worst rains in 90 years.  They said 61,379 people were forced to leave their homes.  President Dilma Rousseff interrupted her year-end holidays on Friday to tour flood-hit areas of Espirito Santo.  \"We are going to have to rebuild the state,\" said Governor Renato Casagrande amid extensive flooding and damage to bridges and roads.  In neighbouring Minas Gerais state, where the downpours began in October and have worsened in the past few days, have authorities reported 17 deaths and said 4,150 people were forced to evacuate their homes.  A 56-year-old woman died on Wednesday in a landslide that buried her house in Juiz de Fora, 278 kilometres from Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais.  Last week, a family of six, including a seven-year-old child, died when a mudslide swept away their home in Sardoa, in the eastern part of the state.  A total of 79 towns were affected across Minas Gerais and a state of alert was declared in 26 of them.  On Tuesday, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff flew over flood-hit areas of Espirito Santo and pledged federal aid to the victims.  In early December, a storm also left 16 people dead and flattened more than 200 houses in the city of Lajedinho in the northeastern state of Bahia.\n",

      "Torrential rainfall, between 07 and 10 June 2014, has caused flooding in southern Brazil where it is estimated that approximately half a million people have been affected.  The weather followed a cold front that passed over the states of Santa Catarina and Paraná, which brought strong winds with the rain. Paraná state has been the worst affected, where ten people have been killed and six were reported missing. Over 130 cities have been affected by the disaster and it was estimated that 40,000 people were evacuated.  Of particular concern was the Paraná River, which burst its banks in places. The rising water level on the river also caused flooding in neighbouring Argentina, and the floodgates at the Yacyreta Dam were opened on 11 June to help control the floodwaters. The dam is located on the border of Argentina, and it was reported that record levels of water passed through the dam.  Floodwaters and landslides have blocked some roads and destroyed bridges, cutting off easy access to some of the affected towns.  The rain was forecast to finish on 15 June, leaving emergency workers with the task of recovering from the flooding.\n",

      "TORONTO – The City of Calgary says only a small number of buildings may still be without power in the downtown core after last week’s devastating floods in southern Alberta that left three dead.  Officials say some structures may not yet have power because of specific electrical or other issues that need to be resolved first and officials say work will continue to restore electrical service to a number of residential neighbourhoods that were also hard hit by flooding.  In Medicine Hat, inspectors will carry on checking homes Wednesday as thousands of homeowners were forced out as a precaution when levels rose dramatically on the South Saskatchewan River.  Owners are being urged to clean their properties if they encounter problems to avoid health concerns.  In dozens of neighbourhoods in flood-ravaged Alberta communities, thousands of volunteers are helping residents struggling to clean up and around their homes. On Monday, approximate 2,500 people showed up at McMahon Stadium in Calgary alone, ready to help strangers.  Earlier this week, Alberta Environment officials said it has completed or is working to implement 13 of the 18 recommendations contained in the flood mitigation report that was presented to the government in 2006.  The work has included mapping the flood risk of 90 rivers and streams.  As residents continue to clean up after the flood, here’s a brief “by the numbers” look at the Alberta floods (please note: numbers below are subject to constant change):  100,000 to 120,000 – The number of people that were forced out of their homes across Alberta due to the floods.  75,000 – Estimated number of Calgarians that were evacuated last week. 10,000 are still waiting to return home.  2,000 – Number of Calgary evacuees still housed in emergency centres or dormitories.  75,000 – Number of citizens who had to flee high water from the Bow and Elbow rivers after last week’s floods.  22- Number of confirmed local states of emergency as of June 25.  10 – The number of years it could take to rebuild the communities in flood affected areas in Alberta.  13,000 to 15,000 –  Number of residents evacuated from High River in Alberta.  80 – Percentage of High River that remained without services and the waste-water treatment plant wasn’t working as of Monday.  11,000 – Number of homes and businesses still out of power in Calgary.  9 –  Number of community support centres being opened around flood zones Wednesday.  300 – Approximate number of people who ignored the High River evacuation order.  5 – Number of Alberta Search and Rescue teams working with emergency responders in affected communities.  31 – Number of communities directly affected by the floods. Find out the latest info here.  1,000 – Approximate number of homes that were hit by high water in Medicine Hat.

      "Wildfires have forced evacuations in two Alberta communities and in the B.C. interior.  Emergency alerts have been issued for Nordegg and Lodgepole in Alberta because two separate fires are burning within a few kilometres of each community, and a rapidly growing fire in central B.C. has forced the evacuations of about 50 homes.  The fire near Nordegg, 200 kilometres southwest of Edmonton, has been burning for several days with residents on a one-hour evacuation notice since Thursday.  Duncan MacDonnell with Alberta Sustainable Resource Development said crews had the fire contained, but officials were still poised to issue an evacuation order if the blaze broke through any containment points.  MacDonnell said the fire near Lodgepole, which is about 100 kilometres southwest of Edmonton, is new.  Wildfire information officers with the province said late Sunday that as the sun set and winds died down, the situation with both fires appeared to be calming down and their spread was slowing.  About 100 Nordegg residents were forced from their homes.  About 140 people from Lodgepole registered at the evacuation centre in Drayton Valley. Displaced residents said they couldn't believe how quickly the situation escalated.  \"Next thing I hear was the siren,\" said Gail Tkaczyk. \"And it's the police officer coming down the driveway and we've got to go. No time to think twice.\"  \"You don't have enough time to really think properly,\" said Evangeline Braun. \"Grabbed my dog and it was get on the road. That was that quick. So there wasn't much time at all.\"  Braun said the volunteers at the evacuation centre have been kind and helpful. \"I want to say thank you to all of them,\" she said.  Roughly 1,260 hectares were burning in the fire near Lodgepole by early Monday evening as winds had pushed the blaze towards the community.  About 120 firefighters were on the ground, with more expected on Tuesday.  The fire was considered \"laying low\" as of Monday at noon, but firefighters remained concerned the winds could pick up in the afternoon.  Residents living a few miles east of Lodgepole near Highway 620 and Range Road 90 are taking in stride a one-hour evacuation alert.  \"Nothing we haven't seen before,\" said Ken Newby as he continued doing chores around the yard, noting there was less smoke than yesterday.  George Cook said he \"didn't think it was anything to be concerned about,\" leaving for work as usual in Drayton Valley Monday morning.  Alberta issued a fire weather advisory for the province Sunday, saying that high winds and dry temperatures made the likelihood of uncontrolled wildfires high.  Residents of Nordegg are being told to go to Rocky Mountain House about 100 kilometres east of the community.  Lodgepole residents are being told to go to Drayton Valley, which is about 50 kilometres away.  Last week, a provincial official said conditions in some areas were similar to May 2011 when flames roared through the town of Slave Lake, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing thousands of people to flee. The wildfire caused an estimated $1 billion in damage, including firefighting and relief costs.  In B.C., the 1,100-hectare Spatsum Creek fire, west of Kamloops and about 20 kilometres south of Ashton, has more than doubled in size since Saturday as winds have fanned the flames.  Kevin Skrepnek, spokesman for the B.C. Wildfire Management Branch, says hot weather has caused an increase in the number of wildfires this year. There have already been 177 wildfires in the province since April 1 — all but two have been caused by human error.\n",

      "While conditions were not favourable for wildfires in most areas of the country in 2014, it was still a huge wildfire year in Canada. According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, although the absolute number of wildland fires was 10 per cent less than the 20-year average, the area burned was three times higher than the 20-year national average (4.6 million hectares vs. the normal 1.5 million hectares). So even with parts of Canada being, at times, soaked by heavy rains or underwater from floods, the Northwest Territories and British Columbia made up for it all with exceptional warmth and dryness that brought sparks to infernos in no time flat.  In the Northwest Territories it started with a cold winter and scanty snows that left the ground and forest litter dry. With summer came clear skies and record warm temperatures that optimized already perfect conditions for fires to spread. The principal culprit was a stalled ridge of drying air anchored over the Mackenzie River valley for weeks. Temperatures from Tuktoyaktuk to Yellowknife averaged well above historic averages. The Mackenzie region averaged 1.6°C warmer than normal – the seventh warmest summer in 67 years. Yellowknife had 22 days in June and July at or above 25°C, compared to an average of eight, and only two days in June and three in July with rain. In a 91-day span, from the May long-weekend onwards, Yellowknife received only one-half its normal rainfall. As further evidence of the dryness, water levels in the Mackenzie River dropped to some of the lowest seen in more than 30 years. So it was no surprise to anyone that the Northwest Territories had its worst fire season in 30 years with nearly 3.4 million hectares razed. That’s seven times the normal acreage consumed and six times the size of Prince Edward Island. At the peak of the fire season, smoke, ash and moisture from intense fires travelled as high as 15 km in the air, easily circling the globe. Some plumes travelled south and east affecting air quality in the northern plains of the United States, the Canadian Maritimes and even as far as Portugal. The fires caused a host of problems, including highway closures due to reduced visibility, the destruction of fibre optic cables and the interruption of Yellowknife’s main power supply line. Health risks were also a concern as the city’s hospital treated twice the usual number of patients for respiratory and allergy issues. Smoke was so thick that, at times, it was hard to breathe indoors with the windows closed let alone venturing outside. Widespread forest fires also stranded visitors and adversely affected busy tourist camps and attractions. In August, firefighters and residents finally got a breather when cooler and wetter weather took hold. Temperatures dropped significantly and rainfall was 50 per cent more than normal for the month.  In British Columbia, an overheated wildfire season scorched the third-biggest loss of timber in the province since authorities began recording wildfire statistics more than 60 years ago. Fires burned more than 338,000 hectares through the province – seven and a half times the normal area charred on average over 20 years. No homes or notable structures were destroyed, but the province more than quadrupled its firefighting budget, spending $266 million. Conditions for the wildfire season started in 2013 when places like Victoria experienced their driest October-to-December on record. Summer perfected conditions for igniting and spreading wildfires as average temperature across coastal and southern portions of the province made for the third-warmest summer over 67 years of record-keeping and one of the top ten driest summers. Record-high July maximum temperatures soared into the low 40s in several interior communities. Some places claimed it was the driest summer in more than half a century. Among the major fires were those that burned in vast dead pine forests killed by mountain pine beetles or on steep, inaccessible terrain, increasing risks and challenges to firefighters and communities. Nearly 400 firefighters from Ontario, the Maritimes, Alaska and even Australia pitched in to help. The biggest and most difficult forest fire was near the Chelaslie River south of Burns Lake in northwestern British Columbia. It burned 133,162 hectares, accounting for more than 30 per cent of land burned in the province this year. Another big fire occurred in northern British Columbia near the Alberta border when a lightning strike whipped by strong winds caused 3,800 hectares to burn at Red Deer Creek. And a fire at Smith Creek, west of Kelowna, forced 2,500 people out of their homes. Over the course of the summer a series of smoke advisories and special air quality statements, issued by the province and Environment Canada respectively, were put in place for many regions, including the Okanagan Valley where residents of Peachland were urged to keep small children, the elderly and pets inside. On occasion, even Vancouver and the Fraser Valley were subject to air quality advisories as smoke plumes hung heavy over the skies.  Fortunately, timely rains and cool temperatures from September through October saved British Columbia from a second disastrous forest fire season and brought much-needed moisture to the somewhat water-starved province. Rainfall in Victoria and Vancouver totalled more than 40 per cent above normal, with Vancouver experiencing its wettest September-October in 10 years.\n",

      "Much of southern and eastern Ontario and Quebec was abuzz between Christmas and the first week of January after hearing, hearing about or feeling loud banging noises and tremors. Police and media were inundated with calls from the worried to the curious about what most thought were falling trees, sonic booms, gunshots or earthquake activity. In actual fact, they were experiencing what scientists called cryoseisms or “frost quakes” that are the result of freezing water splitting deep soil or rock or causing frost heaving. The sudden expansion of the water in frozen soil or rocks puts stress on the ground and the ensuing cracking, vibrating and booming noise can easily be mistaken for earthquakes and gunshots. Frost quakes are louder if the ground is saturated from previous rains, snowmelt or flooding and there is little snow cover to muffle the sound. They are best heard between midnight and dawn when sound travels better in cold air, there is less background noise and winds are lighter.  An intensifying low over Arkansas brought 15 to 20 cm of snow east of Lake Huron and significant freezing rain to areas north of lakes Erie and Ontario over January 5-6. Residents in the Greater Toronto Area were especially nervous about the possible repeat of the pre-Christmas ice storm they had just weathered. What they got instead was a brief shot of freezing rain, with hardly any accretion on trees or hydro lines but enough of a coating to make roads treacherous during the commute. Adding to the misery was a dramatic drop in temperature by 17 degrees that created a flash freeze and black ice.  A surprise, fast-moving wall of snow caused highway havoc right across southern Ontario on February 27. Huge pileups – three 30-vehicle messes in southwestern Ontario alone – and white-knuckle driving were typical scenes. North of Toronto there was a 96-vehicle pileup on Highway 400. Amid blinding snow, the OPP closed all roads in Huron, Bruce and Perth counties, which led to a kind of reverse snow day as kids were left stuck at school overnight or billeted out.  The threat of rising flood waters on the Albany River and sewer back-ups forced the evacuation of 2,000 residents in the northern Ontario First Nation communities of Kashechewan and Attawapiskat around May 11, where 40 homes and buildings were damaged by sewage and flood waters. In total, eight communities in Ontario’s far north came under states of emergency, including Moosonee, mostly due to rising waters.  On June 24 at around 3:30 p.m., an EF1 tornado moved through the community of Laurel Station to the northwest of Orangeville. Peak winds associated with the tornado were between 135 and 175 km/h – strong enough to move a residential vehicle three metres, un-roof a few homes and down several trees. A half-hour later another EF1 tornado struck east of Tottenham. The twister prompted several road closures and damaged a riding stable where it killed a horse.  A band of thunderstorms generating massive rains developed in a line from Freelton to Burlington late on August 4. While rainfall amounts of 100 to 150 mm were estimated by radar, an amateur weather observer recorded a highly localized amount of 190 mm – a two-month supply – in four hours. The heavy rain flooded basements and intersections and forced the closure of many roads including Highways 403, 407 and the Queen Elizabeth Way, or QEW. On some roads water reached above the roofs of vehicles, forcing motorists and passengers to swim to safety. The deluge backed up storm drains, caused mudslides and creeks to overflow, and left standing water on 300 properties and in 500 basements. Burlington’s Mayor claimed it was the worst flooding he’d seen in 20 years. Illustrative of how targeted Burlington was, Hamilton recorded no rain, 3 mm fell at Toronto Pearson, Toronto Island got 1 mm and Vineland received 1.3 mm. Damages from flooding were estimated in excess of $90 million.  A slow-moving storm crossed the Detroit River into Canada on August 11. Torrential downpours in excess of 70 mm over a 10-hour span fell in Windsor and district, filling basements and swamping yards and streets. It was a month’s worth of rain and the second-highest rain total ever recorded at the airport during August. About a week later, another powerful storm ripped through Windsor bringing down huge tree branches and tossing around backyard gazebos that were bolted down in concrete. An Environment Canada storm team later confirmed that at least two EF0 tornadoes touched down − the first in south Windsor and the second northeast of Harrow.  Strong cold winds and relatively warm waters off the Great Lakes combined to produce intense snow squalls on November 19-20. The strongest affected regions were near Georgian Bay where the weather system remained nearly stationary for several hours, dumping snow amounts of 90 cm near Parry Sound, 40 cm in Huntsville, and 20 cm in Bracebridge and Barrie. While the numbers were impressive, they had nothing on the close to 200+ cm that fell in similar lake-effect storms over Buffalo, New York. Back in Ontario, multiple collisions on Highway 400 north of Toronto blocked north-south lanes south of Barrie, causing lengthy delays.  By late September, it was highly unusual to see fields of Ontario corn and soybeans still unharvested. September also featured twice the usual amount of rain, which kept good field and harvest days to a minimum. Fortunately, in late September and October, Ontario experienced warmer weather that allowed the harvest to progress. Still, in mid-November – with early winter cold, snow and winds − half of Ontario’s grain crop remained in the ground.   The Ontario Ministry of Food and Agriculture said it was the latest harvest over a broad area of the province since 1992 – so late that the delayed corn harvest cut into winter wheat planting.  Unseasonably warm air from Texas, along with powerful 100 km/h winds, whipped through Ontario on November 24 leaving 87,000 hydro customers in the dark. In some places between Windsor and Kingston, trees were ripped right out of the ground – roots and all. Just prior to the warmth and winds came heavy rains that flooded streets and forced road closures. Temperatures soared between St. Catharines and Ottawa to record heights, including 21°C in Cornwall. Blowing winds broke hydro poles, felled trees, shattered bus shelters and left traffic lights dangling.\n",

      "For the past several years, flooding has been the big story across the Prairie provinces. In 2005, torrential rains produced summer flooding. In 2011, it was the combination of snowmelt and ice jamming that created a massive billion-dollar disaster across Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Last year, the coincidence of rapid snowmelt and heavy spring rains in southern Alberta generated the most disruptive, destructive and expensive flood in Canadian history – a $6 billion flood of floods. Unfortunately, anyone looking for a break in 2014 was sorely disappointed. This time water problems prevailed across the eastern Prairies just a week before summer began. Excessive rains on soggy ground − too much rain too fast over too many days – led to huge flooding and another billion-dollar disaster.  On June 15, two major slow-moving weather systems, hours apart and more typical of spring or fall, combined to bring a few soggy days to the eastern Prairies. The prolonged moisture-laden storms moved up from the northern United States and stalled near the Saskatchewan-Manitoba border. Relentless rains turned into biblical-sized deluges over three days. Almost a year’s worth of rain fell in some places. Prior to the soaking, three weeks of wet weather meant that the latest rains had nowhere to go but overland. With soil saturated and ditches filled, the water cascaded into channels that rapidly fed into creeks and rivers.  Excess precipitation in the days and weeks leading up to July 1 included:  Rains and subsequent flooding at the end of June forced the closure of a hundred highways, including a stretch of the TransCanada east of Regina where dozens of bridges, culverts and utilities were washed away and dozens of basements were filled. Sections of country roads were under water for days on end. The rains also led to record flows on 17 southern Manitoba rivers and streams. Nearly 100 communities, including the cities of Melville and Yorkton in Saskatchewan, declared states of emergency. Citizen volunteers and a thousand military reservists scrambled to fill hundreds of thousands of sandbags to fend off rising floodwaters. Some 1,000 residents, mainly in southwestern Manitoba, were displaced and faced mucky basements and debris-strewn yards on their return home.  Flooded pastures resembled rice paddies and crop fields featured lakes with whitecaps, leaving some of the best farmland in Canada too soggy to farm. Farmers feared losing their growing season altogether. In Manitoba and Saskatchewan, well over one million acres of seeded fields were flooded or drowned and another two million were left unseeded. As much as six million acres of farmland in the west were damaged, drowned or lying on still-frozen ground. Even though some crops recovered from flooding, their high yields suffered. Total costs from flooding exceeded $1 billion as farmers lost crops and communities mopped up. Weeks later, waves of mosquitoes emerged from the sodden ground and standing waters. Hardship was especially prevalent in several First Nations communities where flooding is becoming a ritual that brings both emotional and physical health issues.  The seeds of this summer’s flood started in the fall of 2013, when already saturated soils, combined with high over-winter snowfall covered the eastern Prairies. It was magnified by an exceptionally hard winter with a deep snowpack and a late spring melt that kept soils saturated and potholes filled. Another factor leading to worsening Prairie flooding in recent years that has been brought to light by expert hydrometeorologists is altered drainage patterns on agricultural lands in Saskatchewan and Manitoba and the greater incidence of multi-day rainfalls. Storm rainfalls over larger areas are lasting longer than usual. The network of Prairie potholes and sloughs has already filled to the brim, and now the runoffs are moving overland in a “fill and spill process” that is ripping out roads, inundating homes and overwhelming sewer networks. Ducks Unlimited said that wetland drainage on the Prairies has increased average flows by more than 60 per cent, and a study by the University of Saskatchewan found changes in wetland drainage over 50 years increased recent flood peaks by as much as 32 per cent.\n",

      "ESSA TWP. – Victims of the June tornado which tore through Angus don't qualify for provincial funding under the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program.  Essa Township Mayor Terry Dowdall received a letter to that effect from the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing earlier this month.  “Unfortunately, the province said with our ability to pay and the state of the municipality, because it is in good shape, that we can just afford to eat that,” Dowdall said. “I'm quite disappointed. I know Premier (Kathleen) Wynne was up here. She saw the devastation, the damage.”  The June 17 tornado whipped through Essa Township around the supper hour, leaving 100 families homeless while others had to clean up downed trees and debris.  The EF2 tornado left a 13-kilometre track of destruction - beginning in south Angus, crossing Essa Township and eventually ending due east in the Essa and Athabaska roads area of south Barrie. An EF2 tornado can blow off roofs and uproot trees with wind speeds of 180 to 220 kilometres an hour.  Within hours of the storm, Dowdall had declared a state of emergency and brought in Essa Township emergency departments staff, as well Simcoe County administrators, to assist the 300 people displaced by the storm.  Dowdall said approximately $140,000 has been raised by the community for disaster relief, and he was hoping for two-to-one provincial funding, but would have accepted one-to-one.  “We all pitch in, we all pay for part of that fund, all Ontarians, and there certainly was enough damage up here that I think council was of the belief, and the residents were of the belief, that the province should have came forward,” Dowdall said.  “I'm kind of at a bitter loss for words how they don't see even one-to-one funding, to help out these residents, to get their lives back on track.”  A letter from Ontario Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Ted McMeekin said the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program is designed to restore essential municipal infrastructure or private property to its pre-disaster condition, so communities can get back on their feet.  Factors include the nature and impact of the disaster on the community, the municipality's ability to pay for damage repairs and the degree of insurance coverage.  “I understand that most of the residents impacted by the tornado had insurance coverage and your excellent fund-raising efforts will be able to support those few residents in your community who may have uninsured losses,” said McMeekin in the letter.  Essa Township was also looking for approximately $55,000 in municipal damages, which Dowdall said was to pay for staff overtime associated with the tornado.  That request was turned down too.  “As these costs represent approximately 1% of your tax revenue this seems well within the ability of the municipality to manage,” McMeekin said.  “We weren't asking for the world. I was a bit shocked,” Dowdall said of the ministry's rejection. “It certainly took a little bit of the wind out of the sails.”  He said Simcoe-Grey MPP Jim Wilson is going to raise the matter with the Ontario government.  But Wilson is a Progressive Conservative, and it's a majority Liberal government that Ontarians elected June 12.  “That's part of, probably, the dynamics of our application, perhaps, which I would hope's not the nature,” Dowdall said, “but I guess that's for others to decide, to read into that.  “From my perspective, when I see what they (the province) have spent a lot of money on, this (fund) is something really to help the grassroots people in the community and even $140,000 on one-to-one isn't a lot in the grand scheme of things.”  Dowdall said the only good news from the province's rejection is the money which has been raised can be dispersed. Previously, it had to held to get those matching dollars.  “We're just holding onto it in trust, we're not actually the ones who are going to divvy it up,” he said. “There's a committee that's going to decide how to do that.  “The community just rallied. The businesses and all the residents just rallied to raise this money, with the hopes that the province would match.”  Asked Thursday how much money was in the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program, a Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing spokesman said the government does not have a set budget for it.\n",

Footage from Chinese state media, meanwhile, showed the dramatic rescue of a factory worker in the town of Deyang, who was stranded by the floods after the factory was washed away.  \"The water level is so high that vehicles, forklifts and excavators have all been washed away,\" Wei Xiao, another factory worker, told Reuters news agency.  Mud and landslides caused by flooding and strong rains are common in China's mountainous areas, killing hundreds of people every year. Deforestation has also made soil erosion much more of a problem.  The landslide occurred in the town of Zhongxing is Dujiangyan - one of the places badly hit by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.  The landslide, which covered about 2 sq km (0.8 sq miles), damaged at least 11 homes, Xinhua reported.  \"So far we only know 11 families were buried and more than 200 residents have been evacuated,\" a local official told AFP news agency.  Patrol members in Dujiangyan told local media that by the time they arrived at the scene, a few hours after the landslide, \"everything was already a vast expanse of water\".  Eyewitnesses described stones and debris running down the hill and covering around eight homes in less than three minutes.  Meanwhile, rescue teams have been deployed in Jiangyou to search for those missing after Qinglian bridge collapsed, state media said.  At least six vehicles were reported to have plunged into the river when it came down after days of heavy rain.  Jiangyou's local government say the river volume suddenly increased to a 50-year high on Tuesday.  \"The high levels of flood sediment, and strong and destructive force of the water, caused the Qinglian bridge to collapse,\" it said.  Two other bridges, one in Jiangyou and one in Deyang, were also washed away, officials said.  Chinese officials said that the heavy rain had affected more than 500,000 people in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, damaged about 300 homes, and forced the evacuation of 36,800 people, Xinhua reported.  For the worst affected areas, it appears that there is going to be little respite, says the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing.  Heavy rainfall is forecast in Sichuan province over the next 24 hours, our correspondent adds.  In 2011, more than five million people were reported to be affected by deadly floods in eastern China.  In 2008, Sichuan was hit by a devastating earthquake which led to almost 90,000 people dead or missing. A swollen river has wrecked exhibits at a memorial to those who died.\n",

      "JINGGU, Yunnan, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- A candlelight vigil was held early Wednesday morning as the body of 58-year-old Dao Qiongfen lay in a coffin.  Several hours before, the woman, the sole victim so far in a 6.6-magnitude quake that jolted southwest China's Yunnan Province at 9:49 p.m. on Tuesday, was still fast asleep.  \"When it happened, I had been sleeping for half an hour already,\" said Qiongfen's grieving husband, Dao Wenguang, from Mangla Village of Yongping Town, five kilometers away from the epicenter.  Feeling the tremor, Dao Wenguang and their children soon fled the house. \"But I didn't see her, and there was no reply when we called her name,\" the man said.  Dao Qiongfen was later found under a collapsed wall, unable to breathe and her waist broken.  As of 11 a.m. Wednesday, about 13 hours after the earthquake in Jinggu County, Pu'er, at least one person was dead and 324 others were injured, including eight in critical condition.  A total of 124,600 people from five counties and districts were affected, and some 58,980 people were evacuated. The quake also toppled 6,988 buildings and damaged 13,842 more.  In Mangla Village, where many villagers, like Dao, are of the Dai ethnic minority group, a Xinhua reporter saw cracks on buildings. Some adobe walls had collapsed, and broken bricks and tiles were scattered in the streets.  Villagers spent the night outside, and dozens of tents were pitched.  In nearby Mangfei Village, people gathered on a basketball court. They sat around a bonfire during the cold night.  According to Liu Wei, most of the wounded in his village suffered head and shoulder injuries.  It was the second strong quake to hit the province in a little over two months. A 6.5-magnitude quake with a depth of 12 kilometers struck Ludian County on August 3, killing at least 615 people.  Although the focal depth of Tuesday's quake was relatively shallow at five kilometers and the quake occurred when many were in bed, it appears to have caused fewer casualties than the August quake so far.  Wang Bin, vice head of the Yunnan provincial seismological bureau, said many buildings in the area featured wooden mortise riveting structures, making them relatively quake-proof.  \"In Jinggu, nearly 20,000 out of 60,000 rural households have improved the quality of their houses to meet the standard for shock-resistance,\" said Wang Tianshou, head of the housing and urban-rural development bureau in the county.  The lower intensity of the quake, lower population density in the quake-hit zone, and concentration of residences in flatter, less mountainous areas also led to fewer casualties.  Li Chunguang, head of the science and technology department of the bureau, said the two quakes happened along different seismic belts and had no direct connections.  Li said the province has entered a seismically active period, but further study is needed to predict whether there will be major earthquakes in the near future.\n",

Heavy rains have battered Hunan Province since Thursday, disrupting traffic, power, telecommunications and raising water levels in major rivers and reservoirs, the provincial flood control headquarters said.  A villager in Jinwutang Township was killed in a landslide.  As of 11 a.m. Sunday, the round of heavy rains had affected 461,800 people in 131 townships and destroyed 1,400 housing units in the province.  Local governments have relocated 50,400 people to avoid geological risks from the rainstorms.  In neighboring Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, downpours have left two people dead and affected nearly 200,000 residents, according to the regional department of civil affairs.  As of 5:00 p.m. Sunday, heavy rains had toppled down 522 housing units and seriously damaged another 888 in the region. Direct economic losses were estimated at about 119 million yuan (19 million U.S. dollars).  As of Sunday noon, power supply had been restored after a rainstorm-triggered flash flood hit Fugong County in southwest China's Yunnan Province, the county publicity department said.  It tore down 14 houses and two bridges, damaging flood-control dikes and inundating a hydropower generation plant.  Local governments in risk-prone areas have relocated residents and allotted them daily necessities.

The tremors in seismically unstable Yongshan County in Yunnan Province began at 6.40 am local time on Saturday. Authorities say the epicenter of the quake was 13 km below the ground surface.  \"We felt the quake strongly, but it did not last long,\" a local resident recounted to Xinhua news agency.  Authorities say that 2,731 houses have been damaged and 75 have collapsed – mostly shacks made from stamped soil.  21,000 people have been evacuated to tent camps, but electricity and communications are continuing to function normally.  Mountainous Yunnan and bordering Sichuan provinces suffer deadly annual earthquakes, with the 8.0-magnitude 2008 earthquake in Sichuan resulting in the deaths of over 70,000 people.  Larger casualties were avoided this time due to the low population density in the affected area, and the unusually deep epicenter, in a place where tremors usually originate less than 5 km from the surface.  According to Chinese media, some locals have linked the event to the Xiluodu hydropower plant – the second biggest in China – located less than 15 km away. While huge amounts of water stored in rivers above the plants have been known to trigger seismic activity, the government has denied that the latest incident has any connection to the Xiluodu facility, which remains undamaged.\n",

      "The Humanitarian Coordinator for Somalia, Peter De Clercq, warned that \"famine could soon be a reality in some of the worst drought-affected areas in Somalia\". The country is facing an intense drought with consecutive seasons of poor or no rainfall, killing livestock and wiping out crops. Food availability is patchy and prices are rising. According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET), managed by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), over 6.2 million people (more than 50% of the population) are now in need of assistance. This is a drastic increase and includes a projected three million people – up from 1.1 million – who are acutely food insecure at crisis and emergency level. 363 000 children are acutely malnourished and in need of critical nutrition support. The European Commission mobilised an additional €10 million in response to the humanitarian needs related to the drought at the end of 2016. This amount comes on top of the Commission's 2017 humanitarian implementation plan for the country. Somalia faced a famine in 2011 which resulted in the loss of more than 250 000 lives. On 2 February, a new episode of violence between armed groups broke out in the city of Bocaranga (Northwest of CAR), 507 km from Bangui. As a result, at least nine people have been killed and seven wounded. An estimated 9 000 people, including the medical personnel at the local hospital, were forced to flee. The church and markets in the city have been attacked. At least two compounds of international NGOs have been looted and one burnt down.     The humanitarian situation in the Central African Republic remains extremely serious more than three years after the current crisis erupted in December 2013. Some 2.3 million people – almost half of the population – are still in need of humanitarian assistance and about 20% of the country’s population are still displaced. A large number of wildfires have been burning across the country over the past weeks, especially in the central and southern regions, causing casualties and damages. The National Office of Emergencies of Interior Ministry (ONEMI) reported, as of 3 February at 7.00 UTC, 131 forest fires, of which 51 active, 68 have been controlled and 12 have been extinguished, in the regions of Coquimbo, Valparaiso, Metropolitan, O'Higgins, Biobio, La Araucania, Los Rios. ONEMI reported, as of the same date, 11 deaths and 6 318 people affected. 1 590 houses have been destroyed  and 583 people are in temporary shelters. The National Forestry Corporation of the Agriculture Ministry (CONAF) reported that over 586 000 ha have been burnt since July 2016.  Over the next 72 hours, a gradual transition of hot and dry weather to cooler and locally rainy conditions (more pronounced on 4 February) are forecast to take place over the areas affected by forest fires. As of 3 February at 7.00 UTC, ONEMI has issued a Red Alert for forest fires in the regions of Valparaiso, Metropolitan, Maule, O'Higgins and Biobio. The EU response on the ground is continuing. The Portuguese Module (52 person team) is fighting fires in the Maule region along a 3.8 km fire front .

      "Southern provinces of China have been plagued by heavy rain over the last 5 weeks, many of them enduring the wettest May for 40 years, according to China’s National Meteorological Center (NMC).  Deadly floods struck on 11 May 2015 in southern China, when 7 people died. Since then, dozens more have lost their lives, including 10 people over the last 2 days, where heavy rainfall has affected 9 provinces and municipalities.  According to China’s Ministry of Civil Affairs, the affected areas are Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Chongqing, Sichuan and Guizhou. The Ministry said yesterday that at least 10 people have been killed in flood-related incidents over the last 2 days, including drowning, landslides and collapsed buildings. At least 4 people are still missing.  Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, saw 89.3 mm of rain fall in 24 hours to 08 June 2015, according to WMO. Huangshan in Anhui province saw 80 mm during the same period. Qinzhou in Guangxi received 176.8 mm of rain in 24 hours to 09 June 2015.  Recent official figures from China say that natural disasters such as rainstorms, floods, hail and drought, left 123 people dead, 15 missing and affected more than 20 million people across China in May 2015.  The Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs said the country suffered economic losses of $3.5 billion as a result, with that more than 70% of the economic damage caused by flooding.

      "HANGZHOU/SHANGHAI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The rapid decline of the strength of Typhoon Chan-Hom has given a break to coastal regions in east China, yet local governments are on alert of secondary disasters.  Chan-Hom, the ninth typhoon this year, made landfall on Saturday at 4:40 p.m. in Zhujiajian Township in the island city of Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province.  According to the provincial meteorological station, Chan-Hom, which packed winds of up to 53 meters per second in Dinghai and 49 meters per second in Shipu, downgraded to a tropical storm at 9 a.m. Sunday and left.  Data from the provincial hydrographic office show the average amount of rainfall in Zhejiang reached 77 millimeters from Saturday to Sunday. Ningbo City registered 217 mm of rain and neighboring Yuyao City 322 mm.  No casualties have been reported. A total of 1.92 million people in nine cities have been affected, including more than 1.11 million who were evacuated.  Direct economic losses are estimated at 5.86 billion yuan (940 million U.S. dollars), according to the provincial flood control and drought prevention headquarters.  The worst hit sector is agriculture with economic losses of 3.62 billion yuan, because the typhoon coincided with the picking period of vegetables and melons and wrecked havoc on agricultural facilities, the headquarters said.  Local government warned of water-logging disasters in some cities and torrents in mountainous regions following the record rainfall brought by the typhoon.  As of early Sunday morning, the storm has passed the same latitude as Shanghai about 100 kilometers off the city's coast and moved towards northeast, the municipal meteorological observatory said.  The city government has lifted the warning as rains and winds weakened significantly on Sunday.  According to the city's flood control authority, Shanghai evacuated 163,000 people and called back 3,000 ships to harbor on Saturday, as the city experienced rainstorms of up to 114.6 mm and strong gales of over 30 meters per second.  On Saturday, the typhoon prostrated more than 3,000 trees in Shanghai and forced the city's subway to suspend service on some stretches. More than 1,000 flights have been canceled at the city's two airports.  The neighboring Jiangsu Province also ended the emergency response on Sunday noon after Chan-Hom, which forced more than 78,900 people to be evacuated and 22,423 ships recalled, failed to bring more rain or wind to the province, local flood control and drought prevention headquarters said.  However, many rivers and lakes are still running above the warning water lines, leading to high potential of floods and mudslides, the headquarters warned.\n",

      "HANGZHOU, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from an east China landslide has risen to 21, with 16 people still missing, local authorities said Sunday.  Only one person has been rescued so far after the landslide hit a village in Zhejiang Province Friday night.  The landslide was reported at around 10:50 p.m. in Lidong Village of Yaxi Township in the outlying Liandu District of Lishui City, the city government said in a press release.  Torrents of mud and rocks buried 27 homes in the village, with 21 houses flooded.  Mao Zirong, Lishui's standing deputy mayor, said the large amount of mud has formed a small barrier lake at the site, hampering rescue efforts.  The local government has dispatched 52 teams composed of more than 620 people to investigate the site in case of any further disasters.  \"We have sent a team of 35 professional psychologists to provide psychological intervention for the family members of the victims,\" said Yang Xiuqing, head of Liandu District.  More than 2,300 rescuers, along with 7 sniffer dogs, are helping with rescue work.  Lishui has reported heavy rain over the past two days. As of 8 a.m. Friday, average precipitation had reached 36 mm. It was still raining when the landslide happened, the local weather bureau said.\n",

      "Message sent on behalf of Mr. Ignacio Leon-Garcia Head of OCHA Regional Office for Southern Africa  In Madagascar, Hellen continues to weakening, with maximum wind speeds of 55 km/h. At 09H00 local time (UTC+3) the weather system was located 250 km north-east of Morondava and is currently moving in a south-easterly direction into the Mozambique Channel. The National Bureau of Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC) have lifted all alerts. See attached map.  A multi-sector aerial assessment of the inaccessible districts of Soalalala, Mitsinjo and Besalampy identified damaged classrooms and flooded agricultural fields. There are reportedly needs in the sector of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), but most healthcare centres appear intact. The Prime Minister visited Soalala today, bringing relief items including water treatment products, medicines and cash.  Initial results indicate that 919 people have been displaced, of which some will be able to return home in the coming days. Over 170 houses were destroyed. Although local authorities have been quick to respond, it is expected that displaced families will need relief supplies (food, health and non-food item kits) to get through the coming weeks. WFP is dispatching one ton of high energy biscuits and 35 tons of foodstuffs to the operational base in Mahajanga where a 500 ton-capacity warehouse is open to all humanitarian partners.  Agriculture is particularly affected by the floods in an area that was already struggling with a locust outbreak in the last months. Over 3,900 ha of rice fields have been submerged. In the medium term, there are concerns over the food security situation. An in-depth assessment by food partners is being planned.  The child protection network in Mahajanga deployed social workers to monitor temporary sites. So far no cases violence or exploitation have been reported and no children were separated from their parents. Information on the districts of Soalala, Mitsinjo and Besalampy is currently being compiled following the aerial assessment. The Malagasy Red-Cross is also assessing the situation and is supporting displaced families and WASH activities. Additional pre-positioned Red Cross relief goods can be used in case needed following ongoing assessments.  As a result of funding constraints, a US$70,000 Emergency Cash Grant application has been submitted to OCHA, for logistical support to enable aerial assessments and provision of urgent relief items.  In Comoros, ongoing assessments by the General Directorate of Civil Protection (DGSC) and the Red Crescent have to date found that around 8,800 people have been affected by Tropical Cyclone Hellen.  In Anjouan, the poorest island in Comoros and the hardest hit, 7,869 people have been displaced, of which 6,142 are being hosted by relatives and 1,727 moved to 3 camps established at schools. An estimated 720 houses have been damaged and 180 houses destroyed. In Moheli, one death has been reported and 1,087 displaced people are being hosted by relatives. Three villages were flooded by storm surges and three others isolated by landslide. Electricity in some areas has still not been restored. In Grande Comores, roads have been damaged and houses flooded by a high tide. See attached map indicating impacts.  The situation is at this stage within the capacity of Government to respond. It is planning to dispatch over the next few days sufficient shelter and food supplies for those affected in Anjouan. Authorities have also started repairing roads. Other relief supplies are expected to be dispatched soon, with the assistance of UNICEF, which has also deployed a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) specialist to assist the Red Crescent in the management of the camps in Anjouan.  In Mozambique, according to the UN Resident Coordinator's Office, the heavy rains brought on by the system that eventually became Tropical Cyclone Hellen late last week affected an estimated 1,929 households (9,645 people) in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. The affected districts are Quissanga, Balama, Montepuez, Metuge, Ibo, Mecufi, Mocimba de Praia, Nangada and Muidumbe; seven of which are inaccessible by road from Pemba (the provincial capital, which is also affected). Any humanitarian support will therefore have to be by sea or air.  Most affected households are staying with host families. Some accommodation centers have been opened in Pemba for extremely vulnerable families. The Government would prefer affected families to remain with host families as much as possible. The National Institute of Disaster Management (INGC) is requesting the following humanitarian support via existing Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) structures:  INGC will send a Mozambique Air Force plane to Pemba tomorrow to take three tons of food to cover immediate needs. WFP will mobilize trucks from Beira on 02 April with 160 tons of food and shelter kits from the NGO consortium COSACA. A full assessment will be carried out in the upcoming days, which will be joined by HCT partners. Authorities will be preparing damaged roads and bridges. The situation is under control and a plan is underway to support affected families.  The CCGC (Coordinating Council for Disaster Management) will meet tomorrow to make further decisions on the current situation and response in Cabo Delgado. The meeting will also consider the possibility of the Ex-Hellen weather system making landfall over Mozambique on 05 April, potentially affecting the provinces of Sofala and Nampula.\n",

      "IDMC bases its estimates on the Republic of Congo’s own government estimate, which was published in its Displaced Populations Report of March 2009. This is the latest source available  Up to 800,000 people in the Republic of the Congo – a quarter of the country’s population – were internally displaced during the 1990s by armed conflict in the Pool region between government forces and rebels originating from among the Lari ethnic group. The conflict ended in 2003, and by 2006, according to a government estimate, only 7,800 people remained displaced in Pool.  The figure’s most important limitation is that no new assessment of the number of IDPs has been conducted since 2009. Therefore, it is not known if IDPs have achieved durable solutions, leaving unanswered the question of whether internal displacement has really ended in the Republic of Congo.  The above figures do not include people displaced by slow-onset and sudden-onset natural hazards. In November 2012, for example, floods displaced an unknown number of people in Pointe-Noire, along Congo’s coast, and it is not known how many of those displaced have been able to return to their homes  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it.\n",

      "Costa Rica saw further heavy rainfall and flooding on Monday 06 July and Tuesday 07 July 2015. WMO report that Puerto Limon saw 174.9 mm of rain fall in 24 hours during that period. Costa Rica’s National Meteorological Institute have warned that the heavy rainfall will continue.  Costa Rica’s National Emergency Commission (Comisión Nacional de Prevención de Riesgos y Atención de Emergencias – CNE) issued a red alert for parts of Heredia and Limón provinces.  Authorities say that the rain and flooding has forced a total of 1057 people to evacuate thier homes and move to one of the 13 temporary shelters set up by CNE, many of them in local community halls or churches. Most of those displaced are in the canton of Sarapiqui.  As of 07 July 2015, 94 communities across 15 cantons were facing access problems after roads had been flooded or damaged.  This latest period of heavy rain means that parts of Costa Rica have suffered flooding for over 2 weeks. Floods in the Caribbean and Northern regions on 21 June 2015 left 25 communities isolated and hundreds displaced.  After a short respite, where some of those affected were able to return to thier homes, northern and eastern parts of the country were faced with further torrential rain on 27 June which caused damage to roads, bridges and houses, and affected over 200 communities across 3 provinces of Limón, Heredia and Cartago.  The heavy rain is continuing to fall in parts of northern Colombia and Venzuela, both of which have been hit by floods over the last 10 days.

      "Heavy rainfall in Eastern Croatia from 13-15 May 2014, has caused large-scale flooding with subsequent collapse of transit routes and evacuation of local population. In three days the precipitation levels have exceeded the average for three months. The floods forced the evacuation of, according to the latest data, 17,631 people. They are currently located in 6 collective centres in the adjacent region, as well as in many private homes of people who took them in. Further 36,000 people in Croatia are currently endangered by the floods. Over 17,000 school children are currently unable to attend school. There have been 2 casualties so far.  Until now, 4,367 housing units have been flooded and we anticipate that around 30% of them will need to be demolished because they will most likely have to be deemed unsuitable for habitation. Around 50% of all crops have been destroyed, and around 21,000 cattle have been evacuated from the flooded area. The most effected cities and municipalities are: Slavonski Brod, Municipality of Oriovac, Municipality of Slavonski Šamac, Municipality of Oprisavci, Municipality of Okučani and the wider area of Županja.  In the whole affected region (Croatia, B-H and Serbia), more than 100,000 homes, 230 schools, businesses, roads and railways were washed out by the flooding.  Croatia has been able to address the immediate humanitarian relief needs in the flooded areas on its territory with its own capacities. However, in order to address the needs of the affected people and areas in the short-, medium- and long term, on 23 May 2014 the Government of Croatia has sent an appeal for international humanitarian assistance.  Over 4000 officials and even a larger number of volunteers have been activated directly in activities related to rescue and protection. Furthermore, the Croatian Government has approved a programme of communal public works in order to contribute to the rehabilitation from the consequences of flooding. A minimal wage shall be paid to the people currently unemployed to join the programme.  All relevant line ministries have introduced measures for immediate relief, e.g. shelter, food and care for the displaced, books for the children, chemical (disinfection) and physical (removal of carcasses) decontamination of the area, feed for the evacuated cattle etc. In a coordinated effort, the Ministry of Social Policy and Youth, with the Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Defence collected humanitarian aid from citizens and have sent in-kind assistance as well as monetary and psychosocial assistance to evacuated families.  Rapidly changing circumstances in the field, vastness of the flooded area, damage on the houses, other facilities, crops and cattle, threat of dislocated landmines and a large number of long-term displaced persons from Croatia, as well as from Bosnia and Hercegovina, along with continually arriving offers of assistance from our friends in the international community, prompted Croatia to issue a humanitarian appeal and ask for international assistance.  On 23 May 2014 Croatia has issued an international humanitarian appeal in order to effectively meet the needs of the affected population and regions. The international community has been informed about the concrete needs, most of which can in best way be covered by direct financial assistance. In general, we have been able to address the immediate humanitarian relief needs in Croatia for food, shelter and medical care, as well as provide assistance to the neighbouring countries. However, we anticipate that in the medium- and long-term there will be a gap between the immediate relief and subsequent rehabilitation, reconstruction and development.  Currently, the water level has started to recede. All available forces for protection and rescue activities continue to work on strengthening the existing and in building new dikes, sharing food and water for vulnerable populations, rescuing survivors and disposing of animal carcasses. The situation remains complex due to landslides and road damages. State and local authorities are engaged in on-going evacuation efforts.  Thorough analysis of the current situation in affected areas has already begun as well as a breakdown of necessary activities and tasks for the forthcoming period. Even though water levels have begun to recede there is a fear for new disasters since the area is contaminated with landmines and other non-exploded remnants of war. Due to the flooding the landmines may have been dislocated outside the previously marked locations, which make the subsequent assessment of the damage, clearing and the reconstruction of the flooded areas even more delicate and dangerous. The cleaning of landmines in two municipalities of Gunja and Vrbanja is estimated at the cost of 4 million euros. In order to find a regional solution for this sensitive issue Croatia is communicating with experts from Bosnia and Hercegovina and Serbia.  Furthermore, we are facing the rising threat of mosquitos in the flooded areas in all three countries. This problem will be resolved regionally with the assistance of the EU. Overall sanitary decontamination of the area is also a precondition for further steps. Another pressing issue is to provide longer-term shelter in form of air-conditioned containers for the displaced people until their homes will be dried and reconstructed.  Bearing in mind a constant change of circumstances affecting the needs-assessment, the possibility of more effective utilisation of capacities otherwise needed for coordination, transport, storage and dissemination of in-kind assistance, and the potential mobilisation of our own resources (e.g. in the field of demining), in order to adequately, effectively and sustainably respond to the catastrophe, financial assistance would be the preferred alternative of support, without prejudice to other kinds of assistance offered.  Croatian assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia  Croatia extended aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia comprising of financial means, goods and manpower. The Croatian Government has provided financial assistance in the amount of 200,000 euros, to the Bosnian and Serbian Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. We are accommodating displaced people from Bosnia and Hercegovina (currently about 500) which are crossing the border and looking for refuge in Eastern Croatia.  To Bosnia and Hercegovina we sent 2 helicopters, 9 motor boats, 15 vehicles, civil protection team, fire-fighters, divers and policemen totalling 52 people. They have evacuated and saved more than 1,000 people. 90,000 sand bags have been delivered.  To the most endangered municipalities in Serbia, we sent 4 divers and 2 policemen. After having finished the operations in Eastern Croatia, we pledged to send 2 motorboats, 5 vehicles, one civil protection unit and one firefighting team, in total 15 personnel. A water purification system has been offered.  Financial donations to citizens of the flood-hit areas of Croatia can be made in two different ways:\n",

      "The figure is the number of people registered as IDPs by the government of the Republic of Cyprus (GoC, 2014) and includes around 117,000 people with IDP registration who were displaced in 1974 and who are still alive.  Moreover, descendants of people with the identity card are also eligible to receive such identity cards and to be recognised as IDPs (GoC).  Displacement occurred in 1974 as groups backed by Greece’s military junta ousted the Cypriot leader, and Turkey sent troops to the island in response. As a result, Greek Cypriots fled to the south, while Turkish Cypriots fled to the north. In both cases, thousands of people were forced from their homes, suffered significant loss and needed large-scale assistance.  Turkish Cypriots live in the TRNC, only recognized by Turkey. In 1975, following the Vienna III Agreement, the TRNC declared that the internal displacement situation was over, and the residents were given the option to move with[IS1] in TRNC with assistance, or to remain where they were with protection guarantees. Since that time the “TRNC” has not granted displaced status or benefits to people displaced to TRNC (IDMC, 20 June 2009).  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it.\n",

      "Torrential rain since Saturday 01 November 2014 led to flooding in Cibao region, northern Dominican Republic. Nearly 60 mm of rain fell in Puerto Plata during 24 hours from 02 to 03 November 2014, according to WMO. Further flooding is possible and flood warnings have been issued for Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.  According to local emergency authorities, at least one person has been killed in the flooding, and around 100 homes inundated. The victim died after he was swept away by a swollen river in Santiago Rodriguez province.  In Dajabón province, the Dajabón River (also called Massacre River) has burst its banks, forcing over 100 families to evacuate after their homes were inundated. Flooding also caused damage to crops and livestock.  The Dajabón River marks the border between the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It is likely that flooding has also affected communities on the Haitian side of the river, although there are as yet no reports to confirm this.  Neighbouring islands including Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, have been warned of possible flash floods over the next 24 hours. According to NOAA (the US Weather Agency) a weather system will mean slow moving thunderstorms in the area, capable of producing torrential rains in a short period. In addition, recent heavy rains over the past few days has resulted in saturated soils and above average streamflows. Runoff from any additional rain will result in flooding as rivers will react quickly.\n",

      "Heavy rain and floods have prompted emergency authorities in the Dominican Republic to evacuated over 15,000 people, mostly in the country’s north and eastern regions.  Over 70 mm of rain fell in 24 hours between 20 and 21 February in Savana de la Mar, a town in the Hato Mayor province of the Dominican Republic. Puerto Plata in the northern province Puerto Plata, saw 53.7 mm during the same period. The following day the Las Americas airport area close to Santo Domnigo saw 58.9mm of rain.  The worst affected districts are Puerto Plata, Espaillat and María Trinidad Sánchez, which as of yesterday were under red flood alert, while Santiago, Duarte, Sanchez Ramirez and Hermanas Mirabal were on yellow flood alert.  The heavy rain caused rivers to overflow. Damage has been reported to crops and roads, as well as 1 bridge.  Emergency Operations Center (COE) said that 3,979 homes have been flooded or damaged and 20 completely destroyed. As of 23 February 2015, no injuries or fatalities have been reported.  At one point more than 20,000 people displaced. According to the latest Emergency Operations Center (COE) report of 22 February at 08:00 local time, that figure has since fallen to 15,475.  The disaster management agency also said around 30 locations or communities have been cut off by the flooding.  One person died in flooding in the Dominican republic in November 2014. Neighbouring Haiti was also badly hit by flooding during that time. As many as 8 people died in the November 2014 floods in Haiti. The country was also hit by further flooding earlier this month (February 2015).  No flooding has been reported in Haiti recently, although information regarding flooding there is often difficult to find.\n",

      "Floods in several areas of Democratic Republic of Congo, including the capital Kinshasa, have left at least 20 people dead since late November.  BBC and Reuters are both reporting that severe flooding in the Democratic Republic of Congo capital has left dozens dead since late November.  Emmanuel Akweti, the local minister for the capital’s inner city, told the BBC that around 20 people have died since 29 November.  Reuters report that at least 31 people have died in Democratic Republic of Congo’s capital Kinshasa in the last three weeks in the worst flooding in years, the provincial interior minister said on Tuesday, warning conditions could get even worse.  Many of the deaths have occurred in communities living along or close the Congo River and its tributary, the Ndjili.  Local media, including Radio Okapi, have reported that the flooding worsened after a weekend of heavy rain which prompted rivers to overflow. Many have been forced from their homes. Those displaced are currently living along roadsides in the city, or have found refuge in churches, schools or other public buildings.  The floods have left many without drinking water after the Regideso water treatment plant was affected. Regideso said that the shortage of drinking water will affect 17 districts of eastern and central Kinshasa.  The rain is still falling and the flood situation could worsen. WMO report that 72 mm of rain was recorded in Kinshasa in a 24 hour period between 08 and 09 December 2015.  The station reports that thousands have been left homeless after the River Congo overflowed in parts of Équateur province. Bumba in Mongala District is thought to have been one of the worst hit areas, where local Red Cross officials say almost 400 houses have been destroyed. Floods have blocked importation supply routes in particular in south east parts of Équateur province. Radio Okapi say that, according to their sources, these floods are the strongest seen in the Central Basin since 1997.  Radio Okapi also report that a young child was killed and around 75 left homeless when flooding caused severe damage to houses in Lufu-Toto, Bas-Congo Province. Roads and bridges have also been damaged by floods in the province.  Comprehensive rainfall records for the country are unavailable.  Emmanuel Akweti told Reuters that precipitation levels this rainy season (October to April) were unusually high, with Kinshasa registering 450 mm (18 inches) of rainfall, or nearly a third of its annual average, between 17 November to 06 December alone.  The BBC says that satellite images from the area suggest that as much a month’s worth of rain may have fallen in the past week.  WMO report that, during a 24 hour period between 06 and 07 December 2015, 136.9 mm of rain fell in Bukavu in South Kivu province in the east of the country.  On 29 November 2015, Kinshasa recorded 132 mm of rain in 24 hours, and 68 mm the day before.  At least 30 people died in floods in Kalehe Territory in South Kivu province after 3 days of heavy rain in late October 2014.  14 people died in March this year after flooding in Fizi, South Kivu province.\n",

      "Floods have made 20,000 families homeless and inundated the main water collection station, preventing access to drinkable water  KINSHASA, Dec 8 (Reuters) - At least 31 people have died in Democratic Republic of Congo's capital Kinshasa in the last three weeks in the worst flooding in years, the provincial interior minister said on Tuesday, warning conditions could get even worse.  The deaths since Nov. 17, concentrated in neighbourhoods along the Congo River and its tributary, the Ndjili, have resulted mainly from home collapses, Emmanuel Akweti said.  The flooding has made 20,000 families homeless and inundated the main water collection station, preventing two-thirds of Kinshasa's communes from accessing drinkable water, he added.  An employee at the public water utility said officials hoped to resume service there by Thursday.  Kinshasa, a sprawling city of more than 10 million people, has notoriously poor infrastructure, with improvised wooden shacks lining the waterfront and dirt roads that often flood with the first rainfall.  Akweti said that precipitation levels this rainy season - which runs from October to April - were unusually high with Kinshasa registering 450 millimetres (18 inches) of rainfall, or nearly a third of its annual average, between Nov. 17 and Dec. 6 alone.  He warned that weather forecasters were predicting above average rainfall through to February and urged all residents living in riverside areas to evacuate.  Congo's government has invested considerably in Kinshasa's infrastructure in recent years, but critics complain that the upgrades have almost exclusively targeted the city's upscale neighbourhoods and prominent landmarks.\n",

      "Enrique Guevara in Panama     Heavy rain is not a new phenomenon in Andean region of South America. But despite the serious disruption the rains often cause to the lives and livelihoods of thousands, their ‘regularity’ means they’re often under-reported or fail to capture greater public attention.      In early 2012 Ecuador was hit by a series of intense storms causing floods, burst riverbanks and landslides. Volunteers from the Ecuadorian Red Cross immediately took action in the worst-hit provinces to rescue and evacuate affected people, provide pre-hospital care and psychosocial support, and assess the extent of the damage and needs.     Teresa Basurto is a mother of three. Her youngest son is 14 and studies over 300km from his home in La Armenia; her two older boys have married and left home. When a fierce storm hit the district, Teresa’s home was flooded and she lost her rice crops, chickens and pigs – her three main sources of income for the family.     Fortunately her home, made from cane and a zinc roof, withstood the battering but she was warned to stay away during the worst of the weather due to a risk of more flooding. A short period of evacuation, in which Teresa stayed with family, turned into a month and a half away from home.     Teresa remembers that the situation got worse because that she did not have a job, but with the help of friends who gave her rice seeds she was able to work again. Regaining this source of income was vital and allowed her to buy cured rice and use it as seed.     Teresa’s experience is far from unique. The National Secretariat for Risk Management in Ecuador says the storm affected over 121,000 people.  More than 7,340 people had to evacuate their homes to stay in shelters or with family members. The floods damaged or destroyed homes, schools, roads, bridges and other crucial infrastructure.     With support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and funding from the European Commission’s Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO), the Ecuadorian Red Cross provided food assistance and hygiene kits and, spread messages on disease prevention and health promotion among families in the coastal provinces of Manabi, Los Rios and Guayas.     The effects of the storms on agriculture have a significant impact on a community’s ability to recover. Rodolfo Carriel is a farmer who lives in Bebo in the district of Salitre. He is a veteran of many floods, but the severity of the disaster in 2012 took him by surprise.     When the storm hit, Rodolfo was in the Community Committee of Salitre and responded to the emergency with friends from the Committee. A 20 meter wall collapsed causing a massive flood which left his family with no rice crops, no animals and a patch of land incapable of supporting his work. The family was devastated. “We were almost left homeless,” he says.     Along with emergency assistance, the Ecuadorian Red Cross also began preparing the communities for the risk of waterborne diseases such as dengue that can sometimes arise after significant flooding.  “I feel very thankful because the help arrived just when we needed it,” Rodolfo says.     Teresa fears that if this year’s floods are as bad, the communities will not be fully prepared, but at least, through programmes supported by the Ecuadorian Red Cross, IFRC and ECHO, they are aware of the risks and know some of the things they can do to lessen the impact.\n",

      "A Human Rights Watch review of media reports and official statements since 2012 showed that Egyptian officials repeatedly gave contradictory information about the smuggling tunnels between Gaza and the Sinai that they used to justify the evictions. Officials repeatedly gave widely different figures for the number of functioning tunnels and later downplayed the size of the buffer zone that they said would be razed to purportedly destroy those tunnels.  On October 29, 2014, five days after Ansar Beit al-Maqdis attacked the Karam al-Qawadis checkpoint near Rafah, Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb issued a decree ordering the “eviction and isolation” of a buffer zone extending between five and seven kilometers from the border with Gaza and including all of Rafah. Prime Minister Mehleb’s decree encompassed a much larger area than government officials had previously described in public statements about home demolitions, which the military had been conducting throughout 2013 and 2014. A map contained in the decree delineated a zone that extended along the entire 13-kilometer border with Gaza and encompassed roughly 79 square kilometers of Egyptian territory. The decree ordered that those forced to leave be provided with “due compensation” and alternative housing.  Though home demolitions dramatically accelerated after Mehleb’s decree, Human Rights Watch’s analysis of over 50 satellite images taken of Rafah between March 11, 2013, and August 15, 2015, showed that the government demolition campaign actually began sometime between late July and the end of August 2013, shortly after Morsy’s ouster and amid the intensification of attacks by armed groups.  The military demolished at least 540 buildings between Morsy’s removal and the October 24, 2014, attack that precipitated Mehleb’s decree, according to Human Rights Watch’s analysis of the satellite imagery. Most of these buildings lay within 500 meters of the border but some lay beyond a kilometer from the border. Between October 25, 2014, and August 15, 2015, satellite imagery analysis showed that the authorities demolished at least 2,715 additional buildings.  In total, the military has destroyed at least 3,255 residential, commercial and community buildings, including schools, mosques and hospitals. All of the destroyed buildings showed clear signs of having been deliberately demolished using a combination of heavy machinery and the uncontrolled detonation of high explosives.  Satellite imagery also revealed the positioning of heavy, earth-moving equipment including bulldozers, excavators and other machinery by the Egyptian military in existing bases and security posts in Rafah starting in 2013 and increasing in deployment throughout 2014. On at least one occasion in the first week of November 2014, the Egyptian army was filmed using two US-made M60 main battle tanks to fire at a building in Rafah, apparently to demolish it. Tank tracks are visible in the satellite imagery from the same area in the same period.  The start of demolitions began in July 2013, but journalists only began reporting on demolitions that September, describing them as the possible beginning of a buffer zone. Egyptian officials quoted in these media reports claimed that the buffer zone would protect Egypt’s national security by preventing Gaza-based armed groups from smuggling fighters and weapons into the Sinai and fueling the insurgency there, despite numerous reports in the media that the majority of heavy weapons smuggled into the Sinai came from Libya and not from Gaza.  On September 1, 2013, the Associated Press, citing security officials and residents, reported that the military had “bulldozed” 13 homes along the border and caved in tunnels beneath them “as prelude to the possible creation of a buffer zone to reduce weapon smuggling and illegal terrorist crossings.” The agency reported that the military “envisioned” a 500-meter-wide “building-free zone with no trees.” Though the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Occupied Palestinian Territory had reported less than two months earlier that only 10 tunnels were functioning, the Egyptian military said that it had closed “350 tunnels, or 80 about percent of the total,” since Morsy’s ouster.  Human Rights Watch satellite imagery analysis indicated that between late July and early October 2013, building demolitions in Rafah were limited to a narrow zone generally within 500 meters of the border with Gaza, and that the military destroyed an average of almost 39 buildings per month.  The military also razed at least 150 hectares of cultivated farmland along the border between July and early October 2013. Satellite imagery recorded during this period showed multiple bulldozers deployed at military posts along the border and the clearing of olive groves and other cultivated fields. Extensive bulldozer tracks are visible over the affected plots of land.  On September 15, 2013, military spokesman Ahmed Ali told a news conference that the army was clearing “buildings deemed a security threat” up to one kilometer from the border, doubling the previously reported area. But he denied that the army was establishing a buffer zone. Claiming that Gaza-based groups were mounting joint attacks on Egyptian security forces with Sinai-based groups, Ali said that houses concealing tunnels used for weapons smuggling were a threat to national security. Ali claimed that the army had destroyed 152 tunnels since June 30, the day mass protests broke out against Morsy. This was a far smaller number than the military had given the Associated Press earlier that month.  \"There is cooperation between the [Sinai] armed terror groups with their counterparts in the Gaza Strip, and more than one joint operation has been monitored,\" Ali claimed.  Though he did not present proof of such coordination, Israeli and Egyptian security sources had previously alleged connections between Ansar Beit al-Maqdis and militant groups in Gaza. When a 28-year-old man and alleged member of the Gaza-based Popular Resistance Committees was wounded in an Israeli air strike in February 2014, Israel’s General Security Agency, or Shabak, claimed that he had also smuggled arms to Ansar Beit al-Maqdis. Other analysts have pointed to statements sympathetic to Ansar Beit al-Maqdis issued by Gaza-based groups, such as the Mujahideen Shura Council, as evidence of collaboration.  On September 8, 2013, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri told the Washington Post that “there are no tunnels, none, in operation at the current time,” and added that this had never happened before. Nevertheless, in October 2013, Maj. Gen. Ahmed Ibrahim, the commander of Egypt’s border guard, claimed that security forces had destroyed 794 tunnels in 2013, a dramatically higher number than military sources had stated in September. Gen. Ibrahim added that the army planned “to create a ‘safe zone’ in Rafah through which the Egyptian border guard will be able to effectively monitor and secure border areas.”  Human Rights Watch’s analysis of satellite imagery showed that during the following five months, between early October 2013 and late February 2014, the overall number and rate of building demolition substantially increased to an average of almost 60 buildings per month. The zone for demolition also increased substantially, including buildings far beyond the initial border area almost one kilometer from Gaza.  Still, in February 2014, an Egyptian security source told the Ma’an News Agency that the military had destroyed only 10 tunnels and eight houses as part of a campaign to establish a buffer zone that would only extend 300 meters in populated areas and 500 meters in “open areas.”  Between March and April 2014, satellite imagery revealed a moderate drop in the demolition rate to 34 buildings per month. This was followed by an apparent cessation in demolition activities during a three-month period between May 2 and August 1, during which the average demolition rate fell to only 1.5 buildings per month. While the Egyptian authorities did not issue any statement regarding this decline, it is possible that this pause was in part due to the onset of Ramadan on June 29, 2014, and the start of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, dubbed Operation Protective Edge by Israel, on July 8, 2014.  In August 2014, “informed sources” in the government told the Al Monitor news website that the army planned to spend two years “razing” homes in a buffer zone up to one kilometer from the Gaza border.  Human Rights Watch’s analysis of satellite imagery recorded between August 1 and October 25, 2014, showed that government forces not only resumed their demolition activities during this period but geographically expanded then into new areas in Rafah, targeting 80 buildings as far as 1.4 kilometers from the border. All of these demolitions occurred before Prime Minister Mehleb issued the decree establishing the buffer zone and ordering its eviction.  On October 29, 2014, the same day that Mehleb issued the decree ordering the “isolation and evacuation” of an area encompassing some 79 square kilometers of land in and around Rafah, Maj. Gen. Abd al-Fattah Harhour, the North Sinai governor, still claimed that the buffer zone would extend only 500 meters from the border and encompass just 802 homes. Despite the fact that the military had already demolished hundreds of homes between July 2013 and October 2014, Harhour claimed on the day of the buffer zone decree that only 122 homes had been destroyed. On November 17, a little more than two weeks later, the army announced in a statement published in al-Ahram newspaper that it would extend the buffer zone to one kilometer, dubbing the new extension “the second stage.”  According to media reports and a family who spoke with Human Rights Watch, the government conducted a poll in late 2014 asking residents if they preferred to receive money, land or a new apartment in compensation for their demolished homes and land. The government employees did not explain the purpose of the poll, which residents filled in at the city council office, and never made the results public, residents told Human Rights Watch.  Yehia, a farmer who lived in a one-story house located in an area called al-Nahda, 900 meters from the border, said that a committee of soldiers and government employees visited his area in early December 2014. They were filling a list of people’s names, houses, and house sizes but refused to give him any information.  Yehia went to the city council to ask about what was happening and was given the form to fill. Yehia said that the council employee did not know where the proposed land or apartment would be located or how big they would be, so Yehia chose to be compensated with money.  Yehia said he never received any official notice of the eviction. He described how he was confused and hesitant about whether to evacuate based on television statements he had seen saying that their area would be evicted:  The authorities justified the expanding size of the buffer zone by claiming that they had found tunnels of ever-greater lengths. On November 17, when the military announced that it would begin demolishing homes up to one kilometer from the border, the official MENA news agency said that it was because troops had discovered tunnels 800 to 1,000 meters long. In April 2015, Egyptian media reported that the military was “studying” another possible expansion of the buffer zone after discovering a 2.8-kilometer-long tunnel.  On January 7, Harhour gave a New Year statement that was featured on a BBC Arabic television broadcast.  “I believe [constructing the buffer zone] comprises the whole of Rafah city,” Harhour said.  A reporter clarified: “This means that Rafah city as we know it wouldn’t exist.”  “No, the new Rafah city will exist,” Harhour responded.  On April 27, the government re-issued Prime Minister Mehleb’s buffer zone decree, and Harhour told a television interviewer that the decree was “not new,” but rather a confirmation of the former decree to evacuate the border area at an “average depth of five kilometers.”  On May 26, the armed forces’ spokesman announced that the Egyptian border guard had shut down 521 tunnel openings between October 2014 and April 2015. Nevertheless, on June 14, the Egyptian armed forces claimed that they had destroyed 1,429 smuggling tunnels since January 2014.  That month, military sources told the Ma`an News Agency that they planned to expand the zone by another 500 meters, to 1.5 kilometers. Later that month, Egyptian security sources told the Reuters news agency that they had begun work on a trench twenty meters deep and 10 meters wide that would lie two kilometers from the Gaza border and be meant to halt tunnel smuggling. On August 11, Harhour announced that the government had completed a survey of buildings in preparation for a “third stage” of evictions that would encompass 1,215 houses and 40 government facilities, adding again that a “new” Rafah would be established beyond the buffer zone.  According to 11 families who spoke with Human Rights Watch, Egyptian authorities did not consult with Rafah residents before issuing the eviction decree on October 29, 2014, and did not give proper notice that residents would be forced to leave. Of 11 families interviewed, only five were warned of the impending eviction. Those families said they were warned by army patrols who told them that they had between 36 and 48 hours to leave. The authorities never handed out written notice, they said. Six other families said that they received no notice or heard about the eviction only from the news media or their neighbors. Shortly before the eviction decree was issued, current and former Egyptian security officials appeared on private television shows calling for swift action and saying that “there is no need for understanding” with North Sinai residents and that “these so-called innocent residents are the ones harboring and protecting terrorists.”  At least three eyewitnesses said that government employees accompanied by army forces visited Rafah in 2014 to register the numbers of the houses and do an initial assessment in the 500-meter zone. However, they told Human Rights Watch that the officials did not tell them of any plans for eviction during the assessment and refused to give answers when asked.  All 11 families interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that they could not object to their eviction because they believed that there was no way to do so and because the demolitions occurred in an environment of fear and intimidation fostered by the government’s counterinsurgency operations and attacks by insurgent groups. One resident said that he tried to discuss with a group of neighbors how to organize a group action against the evictions, but another person with connections to the authorities warned him that they could face arrest and be accused of being terrorists and would lose their chance to receive compensation if they did so. Two residents told Human Rights Watch that they had heard of other residents being arrested on terrorism accusations. Human Rights Watch was unable to independently confirm the arrests.  Um Mohamed, who lived with her three children in a three-story building that belonged to her husband’s family, told Human Rights Watch that she was sitting at a relative’s home almost 250 meters from the border on the afternoon of October 27, 2014, when an officer accompanied by 10 soldiers knocked on the door of a neighbor’s house.  Um Mohamed said the officer told the elderly woman who answered the door that they would blow up her house the following day. When the old woman responded that her family had been living there for their entire lives, the officer responded: “That’s it, there’s no time to talk. Move your things from this moment.”  Um Mohamed said they told the officer that there was no mobile phone coverage, which the authorities regularly disable as part of their counterinsurgency efforts, and they did not know how they would be able to tell their male relatives to come move their belongings.  “Not a problem, we’ll blow it up with whatever’s inside, you don’t have to take a thing,” he said.  The elderly woman said a prayer and responded: “You’re kicking us out of our homeland.”  “Go look for another homeland. I don’t want to hear another word. I’ll be here tomorrow to blow up the house,” the officer said.  Um Mohamed said she returned quickly to her home, around 400 meters from the border, in Rafah’s Salah al-Din neighborhood. Believing that her house too might be demolished, she started moving her possessions from her home with her husband, who tried to find vehicles to move the furniture. They spent around three days moving their possessions from the third floor to the land surrounding their home even though they never received a visit from the authorities to warn them about the eviction. Um Mohamed said she began having doubts about whether the army would actually demolish their house. Her husband said they could stay at home and keep their belongings downstairs, in case “something happened.”  A few days later, the government cut the electricity and water supply and the telephone line to the house, Um Mohamed said, and shops in the area closed. Five days later, the army came to say they would demolish her home, and two days later they did, she said.  Sameh, a young man in his twenties, lived in a two-story building in Rafah’s Nahahla neighborhood, around 480 meters from the border. Sameh told Human Rights Watch that his family began seeing their neighbors evacuating in late October but did not receive any notice of the eviction from the authorities until the beginning of November, when two armored vehicles approached four adjacent houses owned by Sameh and his relatives and ordered them to leave within 48 hours.  Yousef, a professional in his forties who lives in Rafah’s Brahma neighborhood, 350 meters from the border, told Human Rights Watch about how his family was ordered to leave. He lived in a two-story building with his wife and child and shared the building with his sister, brother and mother. He said he returned to Rafah from mainland Egypt on October 28, the day after receiving a call from his sister, who had told him that an army patrol had told the family to evacuate in 36 hours. He found the streets full of tanks, and Apache attack helicopters flew overhead:  The army did not come back to demolish Yousef’s house until early December, more than a month later. He said that army officers had asked him and the owners of nine other houses to carry out the demolitions themselves. When Yousef and the others asked why, the officers said that they suspected that there were explosives inside the houses. One of the owners rented a bulldozer and partially demolished his house. Afterward, the army said they would demolish the rest of the nine houses themselves, Yousef said.  Yousef added that army officers sometimes used trained dogs when they raided homes and that the army destroyed some houses with furniture still inside when the occupants objected to leaving. The use of force intimidated residents into obedience, Yousef said.  Mohsen, a tradesperson, told Human Rights Watch that his family, who lived in Rafah’s Helwat neighborhood, never received any written or oral notice of the eviction. Nevertheless, his family began to evacuate in late October, having heard many of their neighbors talking about the eviction decision. Mohsen said that government officials who spoke on television claimed that local leaders had agreed to the eviction on residents’ behalf. Mohsen said the claim that local residents had agreed to the eviction was false and “just some media talk.” Mohsen’s family’s house was later demolished.  Hajja Zaynab, a woman in her sixties and the mother of several sons and daughters, lived in Salah el-Din neighborhood, around 300 meters from the border, in a two-story house. She told Human Rights Watch that an army patrol came in late October to warn her family to leave. Other residents told Hajja Zaynab that Rafah tribe leaders had agreed to the eviction, but Hajja Zaynab said no one knew who the leaders were.  Hajja Zaynab described the pain of losing her house:  Feda’, another woman, recounted how her family watched their house being blow up:  The General Mobilization Law of 1960, which allows property expropriations “for the sake of martial efforts,” formed part of the stated legal basis of the October 2014 buffer zone decree. The law provides for the president to establish a committee that is tasked with determining compensation for property expropriated during wartime. The law states that the authorities should record the property in the owner’s presence at the time of expropriation and again when the property is returned. Decree 2152 of 1960 stated that in the Sinai, which at the time was not split into different governorates, the compensation committee would be led by the governor and include the warden of the governorate center police station, the senior governor secretariat, and two other notables appointed by the governor. The decree made the discussions of the compensation committee secret. Another decree, number 540 of 1987, amended the procedure by requiring the governor’s military advisor and an army representative to be present at the meetings.  Under the General Mobilization Law, property owners have seven days to appeal the compensation committee’s decision to another committee created by the defense minister and consisting of the president of a court, another judge, and a representative of the Supply Ministry. The law states that this committee should hear the appeal “quickly” and that its decision is final. Another article of the General Mobilization Law punishes those who refuse the expropriation with a fine and imprisonment.  According to the residents interviewed by Human Rights Watch, the government has not adequately compensated residents evicted in North Sinai for their lost property and has made the compensation contingent on residents signing a waiver stating that they voluntarily turned over their property to the army, which could prevent residents from filing legal claims in the future. Human Rights Watch was unable to obtain a copy of this waiver.  The lack of warning, the order to leave quickly and the environment of intimidation fostered by the violent North Sinai insurgency and the government’s heavy-handed response also discouraged residents from contesting their eviction and compensation.  The Rafah city council and army engineers who measured the dimensions of buildings for the purpose of determining compensation did not consult with owners, witnesses told Human Rights Watch, and owners were not allowed to object to the dimensions. According to government statements and residents, the rate of compensation was 1,300 Egyptian pounds (US $170) per square meter of the ground floor of a house and 1,200 Egyptian pounds ($157) per square meter for each additional floor. The government did not provide compensation for gardens or farmed lands, which it classified as “empty,” nor did it compensate residents for lost belongings or personal distress. All residents interviewed by Human Rights Watch who owned empty or agricultural land, even if it was farmed, said that they were not compensated for the land or crops. The government committee led by the governor set compensation amounts without public consultation, as mandated by the 1960 General Mobilization Law and subsequent decree.  No resident interviewed by Human Rights Watch appealed their compensation amount to the government’s compensation committee or knew anyone who did. In December 2014, the news website Masr al-Arabiya similarly reported that residents who had wanted to dispute their compensation were unable to meet with the compensation committee or the governor. Residents told Human Rights Watch that the government asked those who wanted to contest their compensation to appeal at the Rafah city council before the same employee who had given them their compensation check. Only one resident who spoke with Human Rights Watch attempted to contest the compensation amount at the city council. He said that the city council employee with whom he spoke discouraged him by telling him that the process was only a bureaucratic one and would change nothing.  One lawyer from an organization that works on the right to housing told Human Rights Watch that they did not offer assistance or challenge the eviction decisions in court because of the environment of intimidation. Another lawyer said that the plaintiff in such a case must be an evicted citizen, but many families said that they feared arrest or intimidation if they appealed before a court.  Nine of the 11 families who spoke with Human Rights Watch said that the compensation was inadequate to purchase new homes or land equivalent to their former property. According to these families and government statements, anyone who owned property where the army found a tunnel was not entitled to compensation. However, residents said the army did not conduct investigations regarding owners’ individual responsibility for tunnels. A Rafah homeowner and an activist told Human Rights Watch that sometimes an alleged tunnel entrance was actually a hole caused by rain, but that the army still considered the owner responsible for a tunnel.  Um Mohamed told Human Rights Watch that she was relieved that her family, unlike some others, received at least some compensation.  “The state didn’t help us with anything except for the compensation and it’s good that we got it. We were afraid because we saw a lot of people around us who didn’t get compensation under the pretext of tunnels,” she said. “The tunnels were closed more than a year ago to begin with, and it was the government that originally made people do tunnel work after they closed the border crossings in Hamas’s face during Mubarak’s time.”  Um Mohamed told Human Rights Watch that her husband had to wait a week after their home’s demolition to be seen at the city council, because the demolition hadn’t been registered yet. It took another week for her husband to acquire papers from the water, electricity and other government offices showing that his family had paid their bills, she said. After they received a check from the city council, the bank refused to pay for several days, saying they had not received orders to pay yet.  “We were so scared that they wouldn’t pay us and we would have no other alternative to survive,” Um Mohamed said.  The family owned agricultural land planted with olive trees but said they received no compensation for it. Um Mohamed’s husband’s family received about one million pounds ($131,000) in compensation, which they had to split among their extended family and use to buy or rent new accommodation in al-Arish. Um Mohamed said the compensation for her family was better than for others because her building was “old and uncomplicated” compared to homes that might be worth as much as 5,000 pounds ($655) per square meter. Still, she said, property in al-Arish was significantly more expensive than in Rafah.  Mohsen’s family received around one million pounds ($131,000). He said the amount was “OK” only because his family is comparatively small—his mother, father and two siblings with spouses and children—and their house is old and simple. Mohsen’s family was not compensated for empty land and two small rooms on the roof.  Yousef said he expected that the compensation for his family’s house would be around 800,000 pounds ($105,000), which would make it “impossible” for him and each of his siblings to buy new apartments for their families. He told Human Rights Watch that he refused to do any of the procedures needed to receive compensation because he refuses the principle of forced eviction.  “Are you going to compensate me for my house, for the actual physical, psychological or social value that we put into it? … I’m not going to do any papers. If my family wants to go, they’re free. But I’m not going to participate in this farce,” he said.  Sameh told Human Right Watch that his family received 39,000 pounds ($5,110) less than what they thought they would get. They were also not compensated for empty land they owned around their house. He said that they had to wait a few weeks after the demolition to receive their compensation, since the bank would not cash their check immediately, claiming that it did not have enough cash on hand.  Marzouk, another resident, said his family appealed their 430,000-pound ($51,000) compensation, as he believed it should have been at least 600,000 pounds ($77,000) according to the size of their home.  Before receiving their check, Marzouk and his relatives had gone to the Rafah city council to hand in their completed paperwork and ask if they could know the government’s measurements of their house as well as their legal rights. The city council employee responded “disgustedly and impolitely” that there was nothing to tell them and that “the check was coming.” When Marzouk and his relatives yelled at the employee, he threatened to call the army.  After they received their check, the family again went to the city council to appeal the amount. The city employee told them to file an appeal, but as they began the process, he said, “Nothing is coming to you … what’s blown up is blown up, where are you going to get your new measurements? They only consider the measurements taken by the committee.”  Each family in Marzouk’s extended family received 110,000 pounds ($14,400) after they split the total compensation among themselves, which Marzouk said was not enough to purchase new homes equivalent to their previous ones. He said they were not compensated for 400 meters of land farmed with olive trees. They also owned land with a small building, but the government refused to compensate them for it, saying that the building had been built too recently.  All of the residents interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that to receive compensation, they were told by Rafah council employees to sign a paper stating that they voluntarily left their homes and waived the ownership of their property, turning it over to the army. Some residents said officials warned them that they would lose the compensation money and face trouble if they did not sign the paper.  Um Mohamed said that when her husband submitted all the necessary documents, they told him to come back in two days. When he went to get the check they asked him to sign the paper first:  Similarly, Sameh said that the paper that his father signed stated that no one had forced them to leave and that they voluntarily sold their house to “the state.” A city council employee told the family that “anyone who doesn’t sign won’t get any money and they’ll call him a terrorist,” Sameh said. He added: “People were signing out of fear and no one thought of any alternative. [The city employees] told us, ‘If the media asks, tell them you’re doing this because Egypt is at risk and we’re defending her from terrorism.’”  Hajja Zaynab told Human Rights Watch that “no money can compensate us for all our memories or for one day lived on our land.” With the compensation, her family bought two pieces of land in al-Arish, some 50 kilometers west of Rafah, in what she described as a “dodgy” area in order to save money. But she said that the family had been left with little money to build a new house:  Maj. Gen. Abd al-Fattah Harhour, the North Sinai governor, told the newspaper al-Shorouk on April 23, 2015, that the authorities had accepted 87 appeals from families during the first round of evictions. He provided no more details. Governor Harhour also told al-Shorouk that the government had dispersed 572 million pounds ($75 million) in compensation during the first two eviction stages. He said that the government had demolished 811 homes and handed out 275 million pounds to 711 owners during the first stage—an average of roughly $51,000 per owner—and had destroyed 1,247 homes and handed out 296 million pounds to 964 owners in the second stage, an average of around $40,000 per owner.  The government said that in addition to compensation for expropriation, it would give out 900 pounds ($118) per demolished building to cover temporary accommodation for a period of three months following each home demolition. This amount, equating to about $40 per month, was uniform, no matter the number of occupants of the demolished house or their needs. Each of the families interviewed by Human Rights Watch said the amount was severely inadequate. In January, Governor Harhour announced that the government would increase the amount to 1,500 pounds ($197).  None of the 11 families who spoke with Human Rights Watch said they had received temporary housing or shelter from the government, and they said the government did not provide any to other families.  Residents also told Human Rights Watch that the authorities did not always carry out demolitions quickly, leaving them living in homes that had been cleared of furniture and belongings, sometimes without water or electricity, for days or weeks.  Many residents who spoke with Human Rights Watch said that one month of rent for a small, temporary apartment in nearby al-Arish cost an average of 1,000 pounds, more than the entire amount meant to cover three months of rent for an extended family. Several families said they did not bother to spend time at government offices to receive the temporary accommodation money because it was so small.  The evictions occurred during winter, when the weather was cold and rainy, families said. Given no or very short notice, families told Human Rights Watch they suffered difficult circumstances during the transition.  The government sometimes cut water and electricity to entire neighborhoods in the first few days of the eviction, and most groceries and other facilities were forced to shut down. Residents said they believed this was intended to force them to leave. Rain ruined some appliances, which families often temporarily left in the street or their yards. The 5 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew imposed in October 2014 as part of the state of emergency required families to make all their preparations and conduct all of their moves during daytime. The army did not make exceptions to the curfew when asked to do so by some families. Al-Sisi later reduced the curfew by three hours in December 2014 and by another three hours in March 2015.  The surge in demand for transportation caused prices to rise. Some families said they had to pay as much as 1,000 pounds ($131) to transfer their belongings, whereas such a move would have cost around 300 pounds ($39) before the evictions. The cost of housing in al-Arish, the largest nearby town, also rose.  “Imagine a whole city getting evicted in just a few hours, where could you find any workers or cars [to help],” asked Abu Ismail, a man in his fifties.  Um Mohamed told Human Rights Watch that her family had to cover its electronic appliances with plastic to protect them from the rain. The cars that came from al-Arish and Sheikh Zuweid, another nearby town, did not meet the demand of evicted residents, she said.  “Our problem now is to find a suitable offer in al-Arish, because the land there is expensive. We rented a small apartment in al-Arish for 1,000 pounds ($135) until we find land to buy,” she said.  Yousef could not find a car to move his family’s furniture, so his cousins moved the furniture to relatives’ land outside the buffer zone, where much of it was broken or wrecked by rain.  Sameh told Human Rights Watch that his “mother was crying all the time for her furniture that was broken and saying, ‘This was your grandmother’s, God rest her soul,’ or, ‘This special glassware in the kitchen was the set your father gave me when we married dozens of years ago.’”  Displaced families had to arrange for their own accommodation. Many of them moved to al-Arish, while others, especially those working in farming, chose to move to the agricultural area of Salehia, in Sharqiya governorate, close to the Nile Delta, where they could rent lands to resume their farming jobs. Others moved to Cairo or the Suez Canal city of Ismailia.  Some newspapers reported a temporary concentration of displaced families in at least two sites in al-Arish where they lived in tents or hastily constructed shelters. In August, Salah al-Salam, a member of the National Council for Human Rights, requested an “urgent intervention” from the Health and Housing Ministry to assist about 1,800 families displaced by the North Sinai insurgency and living in informal settlements in and around al-Arish. Al-Salam said a council delegation saw 20 gatherings of people displaced from the border who had not received compensation. Residents reportedly launched a civil society initiative to deliver some blankets and medicine to the displaced families. The National Council for Women pledged 100,000 pounds ($12,623) to assist families living in shelters in the desert, media reported in August.  Hajja Zaynab’s family stayed with a relative in an area of Rafah that was located in the second stage of the eviction before they moved to a rented apartment in al-Arish.  “My sons rented an apartment for 1,000 [pounds] per month in al-Arish. It’s not even worth 200 pounds. It’s a very small, two-bedroom apartment, but what can we do? … The government never gave us a single pound for housing like they said,” she said.  Yousef said that the government’s money for three months of temporary accommodation was “farcical” and not enough for “even a cowshed,” and that his family did not apply for it.  Sameh said his family rented a small apartment in al-Arish for 1,200 pounds per month:  Some families said that the army sometimes took between a few days and a few weeks to demolish their homes after ordering them to evacuate within 36 to 48 hours. Some residents had no place to go, while others were afraid that if they left, someone might dig a tunnel under their property, with the result that they would lose the opportunity to receive compensation.  Yousef’s family did not leave when the army did not return immediately to carry out the demolition. He told Human Rights Watch:  Sameh, who lived with his parents and two married siblings, said his family anxiously rushed to empty their house of furniture, but that the army did not come back for almost a month after the 48-hour notice. Rafah families often tried to take everything from their homes before the demolitions, so Sameh’s family lived without windows, doors, electricity or water after they moved their belongings. They were afraid that someone would dig a tunnel while they were gone. “Our life would be ruined as a result,” he said. That month, Sameh said, “was one of the hardest periods of our life.”  Anyone who needed to use the bathroom had to walk to a neighbor’s house 500 meters away, and no one could leave home after 5 p.m. because of the curfew. The family collected wood during the day to burn in the evening for warmth. One night, Sameh’s niece was sick, and her father wanted to get medicine from a neighbor, but the army was firing guns, and Sameh’s niece spent the night with a “very bad” fever.  Another night, Sameh said, when the weather was very windy and rainy and there were sounds of gunshots and dogs barking, they heard a sudden, violent explosion:  Hajja Zaynab said that government officials on television news broadcasts claimed to be helping Rafah residents move, but “we didn’t even see one official … we could hardly find a car to move our furniture.” Like Sameh, she said her family had to live in their house for 10 days waiting for it to be demolished.  Fatma, a schoolteacher, described her family’s last few days in Rafah:  The government did not give displaced residents compensation for losing their source of income or jobs as a result of the eviction.  Um Mohamed told Human Rights Watch that her husband had owned a business in Rafah that is not needed in al-Arish because the economy there is not based on agriculture. He spent “ages” in his career, and they don’t know how he will find another job, she said. She was a government employee in Rafah, but her employer said they had no orders yet to transfer her to al-Arish.  Yousef owned around 8,000 square meters of land that had been farmed with olive trees, almonds, oranges and vegetables. The farm provided them with food as well as a source of income, as his family used to lease it to farmers. The army leveled Yousef’s farms with no notice and did not provide compensation for them.  “It’s hard to see the land that my mother and father cared for themselves and carried the water to the trees … and their happiness when they saw the plants grow from their efforts. The state has always been absent and it’s never given us any services. After we populated [the land] and built and exhausted ourselves to reclaim the land and live and protect the border, they suddenly come and destroy everything, this is the biggest feeling of oppression and humiliation,” he said.  Sameh and his brother and father used to run two shops that earned around 3,000 pounds per month and cost only 600 pounds to rent. In al-Arish, it might cost him around 5,000 pounds per month to rent a store, he said. Because he could not compete with other shops in al-Arish, Sameh opened his shop in Sheikh Zuweid. But there, he couldn’t make more than 50 pounds per day and paid 35 pounds for transportation. The army has forced him to close in the late afternoon because of the curfew.  “How will we survive,” he asked.  Hajja Zaynab said that her older son used to work in trade and agriculture and cannot find a job in al-Arish.  Families who had children in schools told Human Rights Watch that it was very difficult to transfer their children to other schools in the Sinai. Most families’ children missed a semester. One resident told Human Rights Watch that she has not been able to find an alternative school for her child. Those who did find alternatives had to rely on connections in government to do so. The government appeared to have no plan to compensate for the effect of demolishing at least six schools in the buffer zone and did not give families information about an alternative.  Um Mohamed told Human Rights Watch that her two children will miss a year of school. When she went to a school in al-Arish to see if they could be transferred there, the school said it had no space to enroll them. Other families in Rafah with “connections” managed to transfer their children, Um Mohamed said, but she cannot.  Fatma told Human Rights Watch that the government “could have, at least, made some consideration for us and waited for the cold blizzard and the first school semester to end…but they were rushing as they didn’t want to give a space for people to wake up and stop the eviction.”  Abu Ismail said his family could not transfer his daughter to a new school in al-Arish for the first school semester because there was no space, so they conducted her exams in a nearby district where other displaced families also sent their children. By the second school semester, he managed to transfer her to a school in al-Arish. He blamed the state for its “absence of plans” and the “arbitrariness” of the eviction and said it was “beyond schools’ capacities [to find a place for everyone].”  Marzouk kept his children at home and made them take exams at the same location as Abu Ismail’s daughter. He said the family would “see what we can do” at the end of the school year, after final exams.  Mohsen, who has two children in schools, said his wife taught his children at home during the evictions and that they took their mid-year exams in another school in Rafah. When the family moved to al-Arish, he managed to transfer them to a school.  “Some families even bought the desks for their kids. But it was easier for me because I had a relative who works in education,” he said.  Though international human rights law laid out in United Nations and African conventions to which Egypt is a party applies at all times, the insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula may constitute a situation of armed conflict triggering the application of different standards under international humanitarian law, also known as the laws of war, as well.  International law recognizes two types of armed conflict: international, fought between states, and non-international, fought between a state and an armed group or between different armed groups. Non-international armed conflicts are defined by Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, which were supplemented in 1977 by Article 1 of the Conventions’ Additional Protocol II.  Under prevailing interpretations of the Geneva Conventions, a non-international armed conflict occurs when:  The Additional Protocol II further defined a non-international conflict as one in which the armed group can “exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations” and implement humanitarian law, should they choose to do so. International courts have previously described other, more specific conditions of non-international armed conflicts.  Because of the Egyptian government’s refusal to allow media or humanitarian access to North Sinai and the secrecy with which the armed group Sinai Province, previously known as Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, conducts its operations, it is extremely difficult to assess the group’s organization and strategic planning from publically available sources for the purposes of the armed conflict test under international law.  Egyptian authorities and the Sinai Province group itself have occasionally named important members of the group, including “field commander” Tawfiq Farij and “top leader” Shehata Farhan, who were both killed in 2014. But such reports rarely provide clarity and often lead to contradictory descriptions of the group’s organization.  Since the ouster of former president Mohamed Morsy in 2013, Egyptian authorities have at times tried to assign responsibility to the Morsy administration for releasing once-jailed Islamists who then allegedly joined or assisted insurgents in Sinai. In fact, most of these Islamists had been pardoned under the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), the group of generals that governed Egypt after the fall of Hosni Mubarak in 2011, according to publicly available data. The SCAF released more than 800 imprisoned Islamists, while Morsy released at least 27.  Those released included some who had served long prison terms for terrorism-related offenses, including involvement in the 1981 assassination of former president Anwar al-Sadat. They included members of the Islamic Group, an extremist offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that renounced violence in the 2000s; Mohamed al-Zawahiri, the brother of al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and himself the leader of the Salafi Jihad group; and former operatives of Islamic Jihad, the militant group whose members assassinated Sadat and which later merged with al-Qaeda under Ayman al-Zawahiri’s leadership. Nabil al-Maghraby, another man accused of participating in the plot to kill al-Sadat, was also released.  In August 2013, following Morsy’s removal, the authorities rearrested Mohamed al-Zawahiri, who had penned a Facebook post urging opposition to the military. In October 2013, they rearrested al-Maghraby, accusing him of participating in the failed assassination attempt by Ansar Beit al-Maqdis on former Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim. In December, State Security prosecutors accused Ahmed Salama Mabrouk, another former Islamic Jihad operative, of aiding Ansar Beit al-Maqdis.  Egyptian authorities arrested another one-time Islamic Jihad member, Muhammad Jamal, in November 2012, a little more than a year after his release following the uprising. The US State Department designated Jamal a “global terrorist” in October 2013, saying he had also once trained with al-Qaeda, established training camps in Libya and Egypt after his release in 2011, and sought assistance from Ayman al-Zawahiri. The authorities have connected Jamal to members of Ansar Beit al-Maqdis.  Meanwhile, the authorities also gave conflicting accounts regarding the leadership of Ansar Beit al-Maqdis. State Security prosecutors identified Mabrouk, the former jailed Islamic Jihad operative, as the “actual leader” of the group, according to the newspaper al-Shorouk. But in May 2014, the authorities claimed to have killed another man, Shadi al-Menai, whom they also called the group’s leader, only for the group itself to release a statement saying that al-Menai was neither dead nor its leader. In January 2015, the newspaper al-Masry al-Youm, citing a security source, identified yet another man, Abu Osama al-Masry, who had previously appeared as one of Ansar Beit al-Maqdis’s main preachers, as the group’s leader. But in May, members of the Tarabin tribe kidnapped al-Menai’s brother and offered a one-million-pound ($131,000) bounty for al-Menai’s death, labeling him the leader of the Sinai Province group.  Despite this uncertainty about the group’s command structure, statements by both the group itself and Egyptian security officials point to a nexus between the Sinai Province group and veteran jihadists, such as Mabrouk and Jamal, who have experience with armed groups such as Islamic Jihad and would have knowledge about the procurement of funds and arms and how to plan military operations. Former members of the Egyptian military who may have left and fought in the Syrian war have also reportedly planned and carried out attacks for the group. Egyptian authorities connected Walid Badr, a former army major whom the group said carried out the assassination attempt on Ibrahim, to both Jamal and Maghraby. Israeli and Egyptian security sources have also alleged connections between Ansar Beit al-Maqdis and militant groups in Gaza. When a 28-year-old man and alleged member of the Gaza-based Popular Resistance Committees was wounded in an Israeli air strike in February 2014, Israel’s General Security Agency, or Shabak, claimed that he had also smuggled arms to Ansar Beit al-Maqdis. Other analysts have pointed to statements sympathetic to Ansar Beit al-Maqdis issued by Gaza-based groups, such as the Mujahideen Shura Council, as evidence of collaboration.  Sinai Province’s formal pledge of allegiance to ISIS has likely provided the group with better access to money and weapons. The group appears to exercise some territorial control, often in the form of checkpoints, and has handed out food and money to residents affected by the unrest. Since pledging allegiance to ISIS, the group appears to have increased the sophistication of its media operation and is able to regularly issue public statements on its behalf, often accompanied by pictures and carefully edited videos. For these reasons, the Sinai Province group appears sufficiently organized to sustain military operations.  It may also be the case that the conflict between the government and the group has reached a “level of intensity” to be considered a non-international armed conflict.  The Sinai Province group has launched large, coordinated assaults on government positions in North Sinai in October 2014, January 2015 and July 2015, likely killing more than 100 Egyptian soldiers, according to local media outlets. The July 1, 2015, attack on the town of Sheikh Zuweid in North Sinai may have been the largest insurgent attack in Egypt’s modern history and marked the first time that insurgents in Sinai temporarily seized populated territory. Only attacks by Egyptian air force F-16 fighter jets managed to drive the fighters out of Sheikh Zuweid after 12 hours of combat. The Sinai Province group has also used sophisticated guided missiles to destroy tanks, shoot down at least one Egyptian military helicopter and severely damage at least one Egyptian navy vessel.  More than 3,600 people, including civilians, security forces and alleged insurgents, died in North Sinai governorate between July 2013 and July 2015, according to media reports and government statements aggregated by the Washington, DC-based Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. Roughly 2,650 people, about 73 percent of those who died, were reportedly killed after the first major attack by the Sinai Province group on October 24, 2014. North Sinai has witnessed about 320 attacks by armed groups between the October 2014 attack and July 2015, compared to 105 attacks over the previous nine months. The number of government counterinsurgency operations surged from 177 to 451 over the same time period. During that time, the Egyptian security forces reportedly killed 2,368 people in those operations. Of the 283 people killed in insurgent attacks in North Sinai between the October 2014 and July 2015, 64 percent died in attacks attributed to Ansar Beit al-Maqdis or the Sinai Province group.  In response to this insurgency, the Egyptian military has deployed thousands of military troops, armored vehicles, tanks and helicopters at a level not seen in the Sinai Peninsula since the 1973 war with Israel. For these reasons, it may well be the case that the fighting between Egypt and the Sinai Province group has been a non-international armed conflict since at least October 2014.  The Egyptian authorities have justified the home demolitions and forced evictions carried out since the attack by Ansar Beit al-Maqdis in October 2014 as a way to defeat the Sinai insurgents by preventing them from receiving arms, supplies and fighters from the Gaza Strip through smuggling tunnels.  A statement on the Defense Ministry’s website the day before the issuance of the October 2014 buffer zone decree, referring to insurgents as takfiri, or Muslims who accuse others of being infidels, explained that the Gaza smuggling tunnels were “one of the main sources for the entry of armed takfiri groups and elements to Sinai and the provision of logistical support to them and supply to them of arms and ammunition.” The statement described the buffer zone as a way to “finally eliminate the problem” of tunnels. Maj. Gen. Abd al-Fattah Harhour, the governor of North Sinai, said the decree was intended “to defend Egypt from terrorism.” Other authorities have named other tangential benefits to the buffer zone: One advisor to the military’s Commanders and Staff College told a newspaper that the buffer zone would have the benefits of putting the zone under military court jurisdiction and clearing it of civilians, so that it would “be regarded as an open theater.”  “The buffer zone should have been established for years already. Why so? Because this buffer zone is impacting the region of Sinai and the security in Egypt generally speaking,” al-Sisi said in a televised interview in November 2014. “We have borders, direct borders between the Egyptian population and the Gaza Strip. Obviously this area was not fully controlled in terms of activities or trafficking.”  Central to the laws of war that govern armed conflict is the principle of distinction, which requires parties to a conflict to distinguish at all times between combatants and civilians. Operations may be directed only against combatants and other military objectives; civilians and civilian objects may not be targeted. The laws of war also prohibit the forced displacement of civilians “unless the security of the civilians involved or imperative military reasons so demand.”  Civilian objects have been defined as all objects that are not military objectives. Military objectives are those objects which “by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.” In case of doubt, there is a presumption that objects normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as houses, schools, places of worship, and hospitals, are not subject to attack. Civilian objects remain protected from attack, unless they become military objectives. But once a civilian object, such as a house used as a military headquarters, ceases being used to further the military aims of the adversary, it can no longer be attacked.  Deliberate, indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks against civilians and civilian objects are prohibited. A disproportionate attack is one in which the expected incidental loss of civilian life or damage to civilian objects would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.  A civilian object can be a military objective if an armed group anticipates a concrete advantage to be had in the future by targeting it, but the presumption that a civilian object is not a military objective remains. Acting on the basis of the enemy’s possible intentions is not sufficient to justify an attack on a civilian object. “Purpose is predicated on intentions known to guide the adversary, and not on those figured out hypothetically in contingency plans based on a ‘worst case scenario,’” wrote one academic commentator.  The large-scale destruction of entire neighborhoods in Rafah does not appear to meet the requirement under international humanitarian law that the army target only specific military objectives and that damage to civilian objects that results should not be excessive in relation to the direct and concrete military advantage anticipated. Rather than targeting specific tunnels and limiting excessive damage, the pattern of destruction in Rafah is consistent with the goal of having a wide and empty border area to facilitate border control, and Egyptian officials have stated this themselves. Egyptian military authorities have not limited their demolitions to the tunnels and have destroyed thousands of civilian houses and buildings, apparently failing both to distinguish between military and civilian objects and to limit the destruction of civilian objects within the proportionality required.  Additionally, though smuggling tunnels could be considered military objectives insofar as they are being used or will be used to transport weapons or fighters into Egypt, there remains almost no evidence to support the Egyptian army’s justification that all Sinai-Gaza tunnels contribute to Sinai-based insurgent groups fighting Egyptian forces. Though Egyptian military officials—and occasionally their Israeli counterparts—have alleged that armed groups in the Sinai use the tunnels to receive weapons and logistical support from Gaza, they have not provided proof.  More importantly, numerous media reports and statements by both foreign and Egyptian government officials have identified Libya and Sudan as the primary sources of weapons that reach the Sinai and have explained that weapons are smuggled from the Sinai to Gaza, not vice versa. On July 1, 2015, following the unprecedented attack on military positions in North Sinai by fighters of the Sinai Province group, Gen. Samir Farag, head of the armed forces’ Morale Affairs department, told a television program that military officers in North Sinai “saw weapons that they hadn’t seen anywhere but in catalogues,” and that these weapons had come from Libya. Most of the heavy weapons in use or intercepted by the authorities in the Sinai, including surface-to-air missiles, rockets and antiaircraft guns, were smuggled from Libya directly to the Sinai and bought, stockpiled and resold within the Sinai, according to media reports that cited Egyptian military officials and the head of the multinational peacekeeping force based in the Sinai. Israel’s General Security Agency, also known as Shabak, reported in a year-end review of 2012 that “hundreds of standard and quality weapons,” including long-range, anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, had been smuggled from Sudan and Libya into Gaza through the Sinai. Sealing the tunnels arguably has greater military utility for Israel, which faces an armed adversary in the Gaza Strip, than Egypt, but Egypt has not cited Israel’s defense needs to justify its demolitions in Rafah, only its own. The military advantage of destroying all tunnels is thus highly uncertain for Egypt, and Human Rights Watch found that the wholesale destruction of neighborhoods greatly exceeded the Egyptian army's stated need to end tunnel smuggling.  The tunnels also serve as a crucial lifeline of basic supplies for the besieged Gaza Strip. As of 2011, they were bringing in $700 million worth of goods annually, including 800,000 liters of fuel, 3,000 tons of gravel, 500 tons of steel rods and 3,000 tons of cement every day.  In addition, despite the tremendous burden that demolitions have imposed on the civilian population, the Egyptian army has failed to explain why it cannot use along the Rafah border non-destructive means for detecting and neutralizing tunnels employed in places like the Mexico-United States border and the Korean demilitarized zone. These means could include ground penetrating radar or electromagnetic induction to detect materials in the ground. Moreover, Egypt is known to have experience with a third: laser radar vibration sensors.  As early as 2008, after the United States and Israel had put new pressure on Egypt to halt tunnel smuggling to Gaza, the US Army Corps of Engineers was reportedly training Egyptian troops to use “advanced technological equipment…including instruments that measure ground fluctuations and signal that a tunnel is being dug.”  This training, on equipment purchased by Egypt from the United States, continued in 2009. In August 2013, the defense company Raytheon received a $9.9 million contract from the US Defense Department—paid for with Egypt’s US-provided military aid—to continue with “research and development” on a tunnel detection system in Egypt. This system was Raytheon’s Seismic and Acoustic Vibration Imaging program, which uses lasers to detect minute vibrations in the ground, revealing tunnels. The Egyptian authorities have not explained why they did not or could not use this technology to locate specific tunnels.  Furthermore, Egypt has not explained the widely varying figures authorities have provided for the number of tunnels they have destroyed or the discrepancy between official statements that the army destroyed up to 1,400 tunnels since July 2013 and a United Nations statement claiming that as few as 10 tunnels were operating at one point in 2013. It is possible that the Egyptian authorities did not distinguish, in their public statements, between tunnel access shafts and actual tunnels. Human Rights Watch found only one instance, in May 2015, when the armed forces’ spokesman referenced access shafts, claiming that troops had closed 521 between October 2014 and April 2015. But a month later, the armed forces claimed to have destroyed 1,429 smuggling tunnels since January 2014.  Because the government could have and did use other methods to close the tunnels and halt smuggling, apparently possessed the technology and training to detect specific tunnels, and has not made clear how many actual tunnels have been closed as a result of the buffer zone, the mass demolition of at least 3,255 buildings along the Sinai-Gaza border, displacing thousands of families, appears to have been disproportionate.  Regardless of whether the fighting in North Sinai has amounted to an armed conflict, the eviction of the population and the destruction of homes is also subject to international human rights law, particularly the right to housing under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, ratified by Egypt in 1982 and the right to property under the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights.  Those evicted outside active hostilities are entitled various protections, including: genuine consultation with the authorities; adequate and reasonable notice; information on the eviction and future use of the land; adequate compensation or alternative housing; legal remedies; and legal aid. International law prohibits \"forced evictions,\" defined as the permanent or temporary removal of individuals, families or communities against their will from their homes or land, without access to appropriate forms of legal or other protection. Egypt is also obliged to protect the right to property, as set out in the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, to which it is a party. This includes recognizing individuals’ and groups’ property rights over homes and land they have traditionally occupied, whether or not they had written documentation. Evictions should be a last resort and accompanied with fair compensation.  The interference with peoples’ right to a home and property can only be justified if it is not arbitrary (i.e. the power to do so is set out in clear domestic law) and if it is done for a legitimate reason and in a proportionate manner (i.e. the least restrictive way to achieve the aim). Given the extent of the interference in the rights to home and property caused by these evictions and home destructions, the Egyptian authorities will need to have strong evidence that this was the only option they had.  The home demolitions and evictions in North Sinai violated many of these protections, including those concerning notification, consultation, compensation, and temporary housing. The evictions do not appear to have abided by Egyptian law either. The buffer zone decree, for instance, stated that the government must provide alternative housing for those displaced by the evictions. The government did not do so. The General Mobilization Law of 1960, which formed part of the basis of the buffer zone decree, applies to cases of war or general mobilization and allows property expropriations only “for the sake of martial efforts.” Egypt has not formally declared war or general mobilization. Both the General Mobilization Law and the Emergency Law (Law 162 of 1958) allow only temporary expropriations. They do not address home demolitions. Finally, Article 63 of Egypt’s constitution prohibits “arbitrary forced displacement of citizens” and makes it a crime.

      "Egypt has complied with international human rights law and has consulted with local residents while combating terrorism in Sinai, Egypt's new cabinet said in a press statement on Tuesday.  The statement, which sums up the efforts of the Egyptian government in Sinai over the past two years, said that residents subject to compulsory evacuation in North Sinai were surveyed to find out their preferred method of compensation.  The cabinet's statement came on the same day Human Rights Watch claimed that \"the mass home demolitions and forced eviction of about 3,200 families in the Sinai Peninsula …violated international law.\"  The US-based rights watchdog said in a report that Egypt can \"certainly protect itself from the insurgency and take action against the insurgents’ supply lines…in a way that does not arbitrarily harm civilians and violate their right to housing and their protections during forced evictions.”  For the past two years, Egypt has been combating a spike in a decade-long Islamist militant insurgency in North Sinai.  As part of its strategy to eliminate terrorism, the government evicted over 1,000 families and destroyed many houses, with the aim of creating a 1km-deep buffer zone along Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip.  Egyptian forces have also been destroying underground tunnels between Gaza and Egypt, which they say are used by militants to smuggle weapons into Egypt.  The cabinet statement added that the majority of the surveyed citizens who were evicted from their homes to create the buffer zone wanted their compensation in the form of cash, while a minority preferred replacement land and housing.  The infrastructure of New Rafah, designed to replace the parts of the city of Rafah which were demolished to create the buffer zone, is currently being completed to absorb all those citizens who want to move there, the statement added.  The statement also said that security forces adhered to “the principle of not opening fire on a potential threat unless the source of threat imminently threatens security forces.\"  Human Rights Watch argued that, based on interviews with North Sinai citizens, Egyptian authorities had \"provided residents with little or no warning of the evictions and no effective way to challenge their eviction, home demolition, or compensation.\"  The Human Rights Watch report also argues that Egypt has failed to use sophisticated tunnel-detecting technology, on which Egyptian personnel have been trained by the United States, in order to find and eliminate tunnels without destroying as many homes and buildings.  Cairo has repeatedly called Human Rights Watch's reports on the post-Morsi situation in Egypt biased.\n",

      "CAIRO: Heavy rain for two consecutive days in Egypt caused strong floods and damage in different governorates In Egypt. The rains on Sunday and Monday flooded 35 acres of agricultural land in 15 different village in Asyut and displaced hundreds of citizens since the floods destroyed the dams previously built by the army forces in Wady Al-Sheikh.  Secretary of education Directorate of Asyut said that 99 schools were suspended, which left 28,000 students at their homes in the governorate, because of the floods.  Asyut governor General Ibrahim Hammad visited the affected areas to make sure that there are no human losses. He will coordinate with Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab, promising to compensate the affected houses and agricultural lands.  There was an accident in Asyut on Thursday night when two vehicles collided due to the remnant water, mud puddles, and high speed. Twenty passengers died and two were injured on the Cairo – Asyut desert road.  “There will be appropriate will to those affected by the floods,” Hammad said on Monday evening during his phone interview on CBC Extra channel.  Hamad said the damages are yet to be determined, stressing that many areas in Asyut are now suffering due to the floods, especially in the Wady Al-Sheikh district.  No causalities were reported up until now and government will compensate people who lost their houses or lands, Hamad emphasized.  In Luxor, 147 houses were affected by the floods, most of them with cracks in the ceiling, according to Governor of Luxor Alaa Al-Harass. Some civil societies managed to provide immediate aid for those affected by the floods, mostly with rations and blankets.  Governor of North Sinai Khaled Fouda said the international road was opened again on Monday after suspension due to the floods since rocks and sand were falling on it because of the rains. Youm7 reported the collapse of four houses and some sidelines in the governorate.  In Sohag , Youm7 reported that small dams collapsed in 1994, which were built only with rocks with no cement. They violate the technical standards, which is why they were not able to resist the floods which affected agricultural lands and homes in the governorate.  Governor of Sohag Mahmoud Ateeq said that floods caused three cuts in the Sohag – Red Sea bridge as a result of torrential rain and the rush of severe floods, adding that the road gates are closed until they are completely repaired.  In the Red Sea governorate, roads were flooded and vehicles traffic was suspended in the road from Raas Ghareb to Hurghada for 15 kilometers. Hurghada International Airport witnessed a crisis when an electricity blackout due to leaked water from the ceiling.  Nine were killed and 35 injured in a bus accident in Hurghada on Saturday due to the bad weather.  Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab held a meeting with the Ministers of Housing, of Transport, and both Cairo and Giza governors to discuss the current situation and how to deal with the floods.  Mahlab assigned the Arab contractors company to find engineering solutions to prevent the accumulation of rain water in tunnels in priority areas, which causes traffic congestion.  Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Mohamed Abdul Muttalib ended his visit to Uganda prematurely after one. He came back to Egypt to follow up on the situation in the affected governorates.  Generally all governorates were assigned companies and governmental vehicles to clear water floods so the traffics could return to normal again.\n",

      "Eleven people were killed in floods in Beheira province north of Cairo, a security source said, and authorities evacuated 100 people from a village in the province as Egypt suffers from a second round of stormy weather in less than a month.    The evacuees are from a village in Wadi al-Natrun valley located in Beheira province. The village was completely inundated in rainwater.    The military has had to intervene in Beheira and evacuations are still ongoing.    Prime Minister Sherif Ismail is on his way to visit the coastal province later today, state run television reported.     A dozen trucks were sent to Beheira province, home to Wadi al-Natrun, to deal with the flash floods, the housing minister had said in a statement earlier.    As Egypt faces another bout of stormy weather in just a couple of weeks, many eyes are turning to Alexandria, where the military has also had to intervene, sending out relief and drainage trucks.    On social media, Egyptians are using the hashtag #Alexandria_drowns, which has been repeated in nearly 29,000 tweets, as of publishing time.       Water has collected in several parts of the coastal province and underneath bridges, as local authorities dispatched drainage cars and cleaned out drainage networks. Many cars and stores were damaged across the province.    Expressing his anger, one citizen said \"each time we know ahead\" that this \"crisis\" is going to happen, but \"no one takes action\" and the army has to be involved every time to solve the problem.      Last month, Alexandria was flooded after heavy rains which killed five citizens, many in electrocution accidents.    The mismanagement of the crisis in Alexandria last month led to the resignation of Alexandria's governor, amid heavy public criticism.    Two ports in Alexandria were shut down today for the second day in a row, as heavy rain affected transportation and traffic movement, as well people trying to reach their workplaces and students on their way to school.    The news of heavy rain descending on several Egyptian provinces has prompted the prime minister to allow governors to declare public holidays at schools and government institutions today and tomorrow at their own discretion.    This authority has already been used up in Alexandria where public employees and schools are going to be off on Thursday, state run television reported.    The weather is expected to remain unstable on Thursday, with heavy rains forecast in the north coast, in Sinai and the Red Sea Hills. Heavy winds are expected to sweep over both the Red Sea and theMediterranean, leading to troubled navigation.\n",

He went on to note that cotton and sugarcane fields, covering more than 5,200 hectares of land, had also been flooded.  Efforts are currently underway to repair a dike that was breached by the floodwaters, he said, adding that all necessary equipment – including heavy trucks, excavators and bulldozers – had already been dispatched to the area.  Repairing the dike would serve to minimize flood damage in other areas, Tolcha said.  The flooding came in the wake of heavy rainfall, measured at between 45 and 91 millimeters, he added.  The Awash River has its source in the central Ethiopian highlands, West of Addis Ababa, and flows towards the Rift Valley. Its basin covers an area of 110,000 square kilometers in Ethiopia's Oromia, Afar and Amhara regions.\n",

      "Nineteen people are feared dead after violent storms and severe flooding swept the French Riviera, including three people who drowned in a retirement home after a river broke its banks.    Heavy flooding along the Côte d’Azur on Saturday saw the river Brague burst its banks close to the city of Antibes, flooding a home for elderly people.  The French president, François Hollande, confirmed at least 16 people had died and three were missing. The interior ministry said earlier in the morning there was little hope of finding the missing people alive.  “It’s not over,” Hollande said as he arrived at the flooded retirement home and met emergency service workers. “The toll is not yet finalised. In times like this, we must be fast, efficient and coordinated.” He warned locals to take care on local roads, which are covered with slippery mud.  At least seven people drowned after their cars became trapped in underground car parks, according to rescue teams in Mandelieu-la Napoule, with the commune’s mayor, Henri Leroy, warning more bodies may be found.  “It’s apocalyptic,” he told Agence France-Presse. “The parking was half-emptied but there are thousands of vehicles. There could be more bodies.”  Three people drowned when their car became stuck in rising waters inside a narrow tunnel near Vallauris Golfe-Juan, authorities said.  A woman in her 60s is reported to have died in the street in Cannes when huge storms hit the region on Saturday. Water and debris coursed down roads in the festival town and in the neighbouring city of Nice. Another victim was found dead at a campsite in Antibes, according to officials.  More than 17cm (6.7in) of rain fell on the Cannes region in two hours, radio France Bleu Azur reported.  Guardian journalist Stuart Dredge, attending the MIPJunior television conference in Cannes, said the venue for the event had been flooded. He said he had walked knee-deep in water on his way home on Saturday night after watching the England-Australia Rugby World Cup match.  “By half time, the street outside was running with water, and the main Rue d’Antibes road in Cannes was between ankle and knee-deep at its lower points,” he said.  “The crossroads were the most dangerous parts: the water really was pouring down from the higher ground with strong currents – and a fair few people walking home had been drinking, so their balance would have been a bit impaired already.”  Dredge said he did not see anyone fall into the water, although some moped drivers needed assistance. “This morning, there are a few cars that have clearly been swept along and deposited leaning against railings. When I got home the power was out in my building, but it came back on again shortly before midnight.  “I think Cannes probably got off lightly, comparably. It was a hairy walk home, but I didn’t feel in true danger,” he added.  “Some cars were carried off into the sea,” said Cannes’ mayor, David Lisnard, describing water levels reaching halfway up car doors and trees left uprooted on the city’s main street.    “We have rescued a lot of people, and we must now be vigilant against looting,” he added, announcing that an emergency plan to mobilise police, emergency responders and municipal services.  British journalist Sarah Kovandzich said she was in Le Crillon bar a few streets back from the seafront when she and her companions saw water running past the door.  “I’ve never seen anything like it in Cannes,” she said. “The water started to seep into the bar, then we were up to our ankles, people were putting their feet up on the chairs. Outside, you could see plant pots and flowers just being carried along the road by the water.”  Kovandzich said the walk home was daunting because the flooding had removed manhole covers. “You couldn’t immediately see where the holes might be because of the flowing water.”  The power was out in her apartment and water was dripping through the ceiling, she said.  One social media user compared the scenes in Cannes on Sunday morning to the zombie TV series The Walking Dead, posting pictures of several damaged cars.  France’s interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, was also due to visit the area on Sunday morning to inspect rescue efforts, his spokesman said.  Hollande thanked rescuers and politicians for their work, praising the “solidarity of the nation” and offering condolences to the victims’ families, while the prime minister, Manuel Valls, spoke of his “deep emotion” on hearing of the deaths.  The Elysée palace announced on Sunday that victims of the flooding will receive help from the state under a French law that gives compensation to victims of natural disasters. A tweet from the president’s office said it would be paid within three months.  The areas worst hit by flooding were also the hardest to access, officials said, raising fears the death toll could rise. About 27,000 homes remained without power early on Sunday, 14,000 of them in Cannes.  French rail company SNCF said about a dozen trains carrying hundreds of people had to be halted for safety reasons, while roads around Antibes were also flooded, according to French emergency services. Train services are still cancelled between Toulon and Nice, a spokesman said on Sunday, adding that further delays are likely.  “Campsites are under water, and two helicopters are circling to ensure the public’s security, as some people are stuck on the roof of their caravans,” said a spokeswoman for the fire brigade.  Up to 500 tourists, including several Britons and Danes, sought shelter overnight at Nice airport, while a Nice versus Nantes football match was interrupted by the downpours.  French weather forecasters said the worst storms had now passed over the French mainland and were heading for the Italian coast.  More than 120 people are staying in temporary shelters in Cannes, according to city authorities. Donations for those who have lost belongings in the floods are being organised in an emergency drive by French charity Secours Populaire.\n",

      "Summary: On 25th July 2013, CHF 121,847 CHF was initially allocated from the IFRC’s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the Georgia Red Cross Society in delivering immediate assistance to 380 families (1900 beneficiaries). Due to the continuation of the adverse weather conditions and newly arisen needs, however, the National Society has now revised its operational plans together with its budget. The revised total budget for this operation amounts to CHF 215,194. Based on the most recent needs assessment, a total of 680 families (3400 beneficiaries) will thus be targeted throughout Georgia. Unearmarked funds to repay DREF are encouraged.  On 19th and few days later, on 29th July 2013, extended heavy rains caused considerable damages in several parts of Georgia. A total of 4,800 families (24,000 people) have been affected in the following regions Samegrelo, Guria, Ajara, Mtskheta - Mtianeti. The western part of Georgia was the most affected. In Samegrelo region more than 20 villages and Senaki town were severely affected by the floods.  Houses, agricultural lands, gardens and yards were flooded. Cattle and poultry were killed. Cracks appeared in walls of the houses and traffic movement was severely affected. Heavy rain also significantly affected eastern part of Georgia, as well: seven villages of Dusheti municipality were isolated from the outside world and more than 20 villages were severely affected. The amount of inflicted damage is being assessed.  Based on the initial needs assessed and on the official request for support for Zugdidi municipality, Senaki town in Samegrelo region and Dusheti municipality in Mtskheta-Mtianeti region GRCS is planning to assist 13 villages (250 families) in Zugdidi Municipality, 300 families in Senaki town and 7 villages (130 families) in Dusheti Municipality.  The Georgia Red Cross Society is now aiming to assist 680 families (3,400 beneficiaries) with food and non-food items (NFI), i.e. food parcels, mattresses, blankets, kitchen sets, and hygiene kits. This operation is expected to be implemented over three months, and will therefore be completed by 1 November 2013; the Final Report will be made available three months after the end of the operation (by 1 February 2014).\n",

      "The estimate is a composite of figures reported by the government of Georgia, UNHCR, and the UN Inter-Agency Humanitarian Assessment Mission to South Ossetia.  The government reported in December 2014 that it had registered 262,704 people as IDPs. This number is based on results from a re-registration exercise conducted in 2013-2014 by the Ministry of IDPs from the Occupied Territories, Accommodation and Refugees. The figure is a slight increase from the initial figure released after the re-registration exercise for two reasons. First, some IDPs failed to participate in the re-registration process in 2013 and consequently had their status terminated. They are now gradually approaching the Ministry in order to re-register and have their statuses restored. Second, children with one IDP parent are entitled to the status. Each month about 400-500 newborns receive the status, which causes an increase in the IDP figure.  Most IDPs were displaced in the early 1990s as a result of conflict in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, while a smaller number were displaced during conflict with the Russian Federation over South Ossetia in August 2008.  The number of IDPs registered by the government includes people who have returned home to Abkhazia, but does not include people displaced within Abkhazia and South Ossetia. No official survey has been conducted there by the Georgian authorities as these regions are not under its control.  The IDMC estimate of 232,700 internally displaced is arrived at by:  deducting from the official government figure of 262,704  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it.\n",

This page will automatically refresh every 30 minutes as we might be adding updates (mostly, but not exclusively for earthquakes with a damaging potential). Keep it open in a browser tab.  Update February 5 :   A scientific team, including 100 engineers along with seismologists and engineers from the Technical Chamber of Greece, have already come to the island to inspect all public buildings. According to first estimates, around 600 buildings are deemed demolished, 1,100 heavy damaged and 1,400 with minor damage throughout the region of Palliki while there are several problems in public infrastructure such as roads, ports and public buildings that need restoration.  Update Jan. 27, 10:33 UTC: Seven people suffered minor injuries due to falling objects, officials said. More than 2000 people (temporarily) had to leave their damaged houses.  Update 19:20 UTC: The strong aftershock was also felt in parts of Albania (Tirana) and Italy. A second quake, M 4.2, followed at 19:12 UTC.  Update 19:12 UTC: The revised data from greek authorities say the aftershock had M 5.2. Stong enough to cause new damage and make the night even more uncomfortable. Another shock, M 4.2, followed 15 minutes later. (More Info about the aftershock here)  Update 19:09 UTC: News from the mainshock: At least 2 people are confirmed to be slightly injured. They went to the hospital in Argostoli. Due to the damage caused to tis hospital, mainly to its roof, it was decided to evacuate it. Patients were transferred to the next wooden building.  Update 18:56 UTC: The new quake (aftershock), happening at 18:45 UTC, is specified with Magnitude 4.9 by greek authorities (preliminary data).  Update 17:59 UTC: Schools across Cephalonia will be closed Monday in order for the necessary verifications of the building structures to be made.  Update 16:59 UTC: Nearly every building in Lixouri suffered at least minor damage. Many buildings, esspecially pubic buildings like schools, show severe damage like collapsed walls and roofs. Other places on Cephalonia, for example the airport, are also affected. Authorities are working to organize a save supply of  food and water for the earthquake victims. Most of them won't return to their homes and stay outside during the coming night.  Update 16:48 UTC: Some people are treated in the hospital of Argostoli for minor injuries, mainly caused by falling objects / debris and broken glass.  Update 15:44 UTC: One house in Kounopetra collapsed, luckily without affecting people. An relatively large ash emission of the volcano Etna on Sicily (Italy) followed shortly after this quake was felt there. A connection of both events is possible.  Update 15:18 UTC: Also the neighbour island Zakynthos (south of Cephalonia) reports minor damage to buildings, mainly broken windows.  Update 15:04 UTC: The greek Secretary of Interior is going to visit the earthquake area later today. Newspapers report that Lixouri is the most affected area. Many houses there suffered damage in diverse extent. No injuries or collapsed houses so far, but the quake also caused rockfalls and minor landslides in parts of the island!  Update 14:53 UTC: Power supply is interrupted in Fiskardo, located in northern Cephalonia. More damage reports coming in from different parts of the Island, so far \"only\" bricks falling from walls, cracks and other limited damage, but it seems that several buildings are affected. In Lixouri a hospice and some homes were demolished.  Update 14:48 UTC: Damaged buildings are reported from Lixouri, located only 6 km from the epicenter. No details about the damage are available yet.  Update 14:37 UTC: First reports mentioning cracked roads and a chaotic situation on Cephalonia. Most people were frightened by the earthquake and ran to the streets. Fire brigade and police are checking for possible damaged buildings and injuries.  Update 14:33 UTC: So far, 2 aftershocks with M 4.1 and 4.2 were registered. More are expected to follow. People on Cephalonia should be prepared for it. Residents of Kefalonia are scared. This event reminded them about the great earthquake of 1953 (M 7.2), where hundreds of people lost their lives.  Update 14:29 UTC: The magnitude was revised to 5.8. A shallow depth of only 17 km is given by greek authorities. Quakes with this magnitude and shallow depth happening in populated locations can cause heavy damage, esspecially to buildings with poor construction.  Update 14:21 UTC: People report the shaking also from distant countries, like Albania, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Southern Italy.  A strong quake with magnitude 5.7 shook the greek island Cephalonia a few minutes ago. The shocks were also felt in Athens. The epicenter is located in the western part of the island.

      "A landslide caused by recent heavy rain has prompted disaster management authorities in Guatemala to evacuate over 300.  The landslide occurred during the morning of Saturday, 11 July 2015, in the municipality of Chinautla, in the department of Guatemala. The country’s disaster management agency, CONRED, say that the landslide completely destroyed 10 houses and damaged 11 others. A further 49 homes are thought to be at risk, prompting CONRED to evacuate 350 people in total.  Around 46 of those displaced are currently staying in a local community hall, while the rest have found temporary accommodation with family or friends.  No deaths or injuries have been reported. CONRED have distributed blankets and sleeping mats, hygiene kits and clean water to those affected by the landslide.  Guatemala’s meteorological department INSIVUMEH said that northern areas of the country could see more than 40mm of rain in the next 24 hours. Currently three rivers or lakes in the northern Petén Department are above normal maximum levels: Río La Pasión, Lago Petén Itzá, and Rìo Usumacinta.  INSIVUMEH also warned that further heavy rainfall is likely from Wednesday 15 July, especially in southern and central regions.  Heavy rain across parts of central America over the last 2 weeks has also affected Nicaragua where the Escondido river has overflowed in El Rama, and Costa Rica, where over 1,000 people have been evacuated after over 2 weeks of flooding.\n",

      "This figure includes 242,000 IDPs who were displaced during the civil conflict. This specific number is based upon estimates published by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in 1997.  Since then, updated figures on internal displacement have not been gathered at the country level.  The government pledged to address the specific needs and vulnerabilities of IDPs within its general anti-poverty interventions. However, at the end of 2007 the government had not agreed on criteria to include IDPs in a national reparation programme and it is unclear how many people can still be considered as displaced, if any.  The total figure, however, does not take into account organized groups of displaced people, nor it includes disaster-induced displacement figure, which as of December 2013 was of 93 IDPs who were displaced by an earthquake.  Displacement is a result of the conflict that opposed the government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity armed group. Between 1981 and 1983 when violence reached its most critical stage, the Guatemalan government launched operations tierra arrasada (“obliterated earth”), which meant to massacre entire communities in order to eliminate potential cooperation between the armed groups and their social base. As a consequence massive displacements occurred. The conflict towards 1997, after the signature of several peace agreements, and left between 500,000 and 1.5 million people displaced, most of them indigenous.  Many of the country’s IDPs have returned or resettled in areas where they live under similar conditions as before they were displaced. Many face extreme poverty and marginalisation.  In addition, there is evidence of new displacement caused by organized crime, street gangs and maras, as well as other territorial conflicts associated with illegal resources exploitation and land appropriation. Although there are no official figures about these new displacements, there is evidence of forced evictions carried out in 2011.  Furthermore, drug trafficking organisations and gangs seeking strategic territory in order to extract palm oil and smuggle merchandise through the border, forcibly displaced 470 families from Peten. In total, the press reported that 350 families have been displaced by violence.  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it.\n",

      "Flood-affected areas in the northern city of Cap-Haitien and other neighbouring towns following heavy rains. Photo Credit: MINUSTAH  Port-au-Prince - Haiti’s Department of Civil Protection in partnership with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has been working non-stop to assist flood-affected families in the northern city of Cap-Haitien and other neighbouring towns following heavy rains, floods and landslides that killed 17 people, five of them children. More than 15,000 houses were flooded, 90 were destroyed and 800 were severely damaged. Over 6,500 people are temporarily housed in emergency shelters.  The recent floods have also affected over 2,200 hectares of crops in one of the country’s most fertile areas.  “This hurricane season is nearly over and has been relatively mild in Haiti, but the recent storms have once again showed the country’s vulnerability to natural disasters,” said UNDP Haiti Senior Country Director Sophie de Caen, adding that UNDP and the UN family have been immediately working with the Government to mobilize resources and provide support to the most affected populations.  ”However, these floods actually showed that Haiti is strengthening its disaster prevention capacity: as a result of UNDP’s work to improve Haiti’s Civil Protection Department and its effectiveness, the response to the recent floods was entirely led by national authorities.”  Moreover, around 40 UNDP experts work directly with the Government and its Emergency Operation Centers at the national and local levels.  To mitigate the impact of floods and other natural disasters, UNDP and the Haitian Government have also planted close to nine million trees and worked with farmers to plant more resistant crops that prevent erosion. In addition, flood mitigation measures have been improved, using watershed management tools and protecting riverbanks.  “It is clear that the Government’s recent efforts with its partners—including UNDP—to boost resilience, particularly in the north and northeastern areas, are a step in the right direction,” de Caen said.\n",

      "Local authorities say that Nicaragua and Honduras have experienced heavy rainfall during the first two weeks of June, causing floods which have left a total of 8 people dead and 2 missing.  In Nicaragua, the disaster management agency, Sistema Nacional para la Prevención, Mitigación y Atención de Desastres (SINAPRED), say that heavy rain between 02 and 14 June has left 6 people dead, and affected 35,350 in 7,041 households. As of 15 June, there were 129 families displaced by the floods and severe weather, most of them in Managua municipality. The families are currently being housed in shelters or temporary accommodation.  The heavy rain and ensuing floods have affected 11 departments of the country – Managua, Madriz, Carazo, Nueva Segovia, León, Matagalpa, Masaya, Chinandega, Esteli, Granada and the North Caribbean Coast Region.  According to SINAPRED figures, 6,975 homes have been flooded over the last 2 weeks, with at least 22 homes have been completely destroyed, and a further 44 severely damaged. Two schools have been destroyed in the floods, with 10 other schools damaged.  On Monday 15 June, the heavy rain prompted SINAPRED to issue landslide warnings for those living in communities near the volcanoes in the country.  Dr. Guillermo Gonzalez, Co Director SINAPRED, said that the slopes of active volcanoes, including San Cristobal, Telica Momotombo and Concepción, as well as inactive volcanoes such as Casitas, Santa Clara, Mombacho and Maderas, have been made unstable by the heavy rains, increasing the possibility of sudden landslides which could cause damage to crops and infrastructure and the loss of human lives.  Given that such landslides can occur suddenly, Dr. Gonzalez said that it is very difficult to give effective early warnings. He recommended those in vulnerable areas refer to hazard maps produced by Instituto Nicaragüense de Estudios Territoriales (INETER) to assess the conditions of the communities most at risk.  Local media in Honduras are reporting that the country has also been badly affected by heavy rain and resulting floods over the last few days.  As of 15 June 2015, at least two people have died and another two are missing, over 500 have been affected and over 115 homes have been damaged. Over 100 people have been displaced by floods in the last few days, most of them in Siguatepeque but also some in Tegucigalpa.\n",

      "North, central and coastal districts of Odisha are facing massive floods since August 5, 2014 due to the rise in the waters of the rivers Mahanadi, Baitarani, Budhabalanga, Subarnarekha and their tributaries. Release of excess water from dams in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh and incessant rains worsened the situation.  Government deployed 11 battalions of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and 30 battalions of Odisha State Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF). Rescue operations were completed on August 9, 2014.  Oxfam’s team carried out a rapid assessment in the worst affected Jajpur and Puri districts, where most of the villages are still submerged 15 ft deep, 8 out of 10 blocks in Jajpur and 6 out of 11 blocks in Puri district are still cut off and can be reached only via boats.  Families took shelter in school buildings, Panchayat Ghar (village meeting halls) and on higher grounds. Many are living on embankments in make shift shelters with their families and livestock. The food and financial security of the agrarian community has been impacted for a long term. With inadequate availability of drinking water supply, poor sanitation facilities and risky hygiene practices, there are high chances of worsening of water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) situation in the affected areas.  Due to the lack of immediate healthcare, cases of diarrhea, fever, common cold, fungal infections are now being reported. There are many 0-5 year old children, lactating and pregnant women who need immediate medical attention.  Many from displaced communities are landless daily wage labourers with no work available at the moment. The Scheduled Caste (SC) communities in the affected villages are worst hit and have no access to food, livelihood, shelter and WaSH. They are relying 100% on government relief for food.  Temporary shelters close to each other, people share this space on the embankment with their livestock. Some are living on road sides, high lands and on roof tops of concrete houses almost marooned in the flood waters. They are living in shelters made wood frames and tarpaulin.  The flood water has contaminated the tube wells, ponds and other water sources.  Education of children from primary school is disrupted the buildings have been converted to a temporary relief shelter in Jajpur district. In Puri, school buildings are still submerged in flood water  Food aid was available for ten days when 243 free community kitchens fed over 86,330 populations with cooked food. State government mobilized 77,856 quintals of rice, 5,221 quintals of flattened rice, 404 quintals of jiggery and 1,606 polythene rolls as emergency relief. Frontline health workers were mobilised by the health department to provide water disinfecting halogen tablets, ORS packets, anti-fungal and anti-diarrheal drugs. A government survey of damage of shelter and crop is yet to start.  Dasarathpur block of Jajpur district was caught unawares, as this area is protected from flooding by the embankment. The people were not prepared for the flood, the first in 50 years, and therefore do not have sufficient coping mechanisms. Many have been displaced and are now housed in emergency shelters at schools and GP Offices. Many schools are non functional as many of them are being used as shelters while some are still submerged.  Dasratpur Block residents evacuated their villages and moved to embankments along with their livestock. All low-lying areas and crop fields of the assessed villages were submerged under water. Only means of access available to Rapid Assessment team were boats provided by the administration and NGOs. But the frequency of availability of boats within the villages is low, limiting the mobility of the community to access basic amenities at block level. The block administration has provided only one boat in Kanas block of Puri district and 21 boats in Jajpur district.  Most of the households do not have food grains and are dependent on relief received from government, which is minimal. A few local community leaders are providing some food aid. In few villages, local community based organisations are also supporting those affected with cooked food.\n",

      "Heavy and intense monsoon rain has devastated vulnerable communities across India as well as areas of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. We are asking for your help to provide urgent humanitarian support.  At least 280 people died and around five million people were affected, following recent incessant rain in Jammu and Kashmir in northern India.  Raging floodwaters destroyed homes, sunk entire villages and deluged Srinagar city. More than 80% of areas in the city were underwater.  Our local partner Church Auxliary for Social Action (CASA) and Act Now for Harmony and Democracy (ANHAD) is responding now meeting the immediate needs for shelter, medical supplies and safe drinking water.  Our Regional Emergency Manager, Dipankar Patnaik said: ‘With winter fast approaching, this is an anxious time. It will soon be bitterly cold at night. Families have lost clothing and bedding. If people’s homes haven’t been totally destroyed, they are finding that they are simply too damaged or damp to live in. As ever, it’s the poorest and most marginalised who are hardest hit.’  Our partners have already distributed 4,000 blankets, 1,500 solar lanterns and 250 pressure cookers. With your support we could reach more of the worst affected.  Alongside providing vital food relief, our partners are ensuring clean drinking water by filtering polluted water sources and distributing water purification tablets.  Since last July, torrential rain has caused severe flooding and affected 3.6 million people in Odisha state, eastern India.  Though water is abundant, it is dangerous to drink. CASA is providing community kitchens, filtering water from open wells and distributing vital water purification tablets.  We will be meeting the desperate need for shelter aiming to reach 650 households with tarpaulins, ground sheets and mosquito nets.  We also aim to support 500 households with cash-for-work, a much needed source of income in the aftermath of an emergency.  Our Regional Emergency Manager, Dipankar Patnaik said: ‘Flooding on this scale is devastating. Communities in affected areas rely on farming to earn a living and feed themselves. For many that’s all gone. It’s an anxious and uncertain time.  ‘In an effort to make ends meet, households are often forced to sell whatever might be left of their belongings and slide deeper into debt. With no savings to fall back on, cash-for-work is vital.’  Those involved help clear debris and repair people’s homes. It provides a much needed income for the most vulnerable while serving the community.  More than 1 million people were affected by flooding in Uttar Pradesh.  Around 1,100 villages were flooded, forcing families to seek refuge on nearby embankments and along the national highway.  Our partners, including Poorvanchal Gramin Vikas Sansathan (PGVS), are responding, aiming to reach 5,500 people with essential relief items including food, tarpaulins, mosquito nets, buckets and soap.\n",
