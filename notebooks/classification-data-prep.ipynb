      "Flash flooding across Afghanistan and Pakistan has left more than 160 dead and dozens stranded in one of South Asia's worst natural disasters this year, say officials.  The flooding, caused by unusually heavy rain, has left villagers stuck in remote areas without shelter, food or power.  Mountainous Afghanistan was the worst hit, with 61 people killed and approximately 500 traditional mud-brick homes washed away in more than a dozen villages in Sarobi, a rural district less than an hour from Kabul, officials said.  Floods left a village devastated in the remote eastern Afghan province of Nuristan. At least 60 homes were destroyed across three districts, said provincial spokesman Mohammad Yusufi. No one was killed.  Authorities have been unable to deliver aid to some badly affected villages by land as roads in the area are controlled by the Taliban, Yusufi added.  “We have asked the national government for help as have an overwhelming number of locals asking for assistance, but this is a Taliban-ridden area,” Yusufi said.  At least 24 people were also died in two other eastern border provinces, Khost and Nangarhar, according to local officials. More than fifty homes and shops were destroyed and thousands of acres of farmland flooded.  In Pakistan monsoon rains claimed more than 80 lives, local media reported. Houses collapsing, drowning and electrocution all pushed up the death toll, said Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon.  In Karachi, the commercial capital and a southern port city that is home to 18 million people, poor neighborhoods were submerged waist-deep in water and many precincts suffered long power outages. Deaths were also reported in the north and west of the country.  Additional reporting by Reuters 2\n",

      "15 families evacuated Sunday, October 18, 2015 Earthquake in Salta kills a 94-year-old woman, injures 30  The debris of collapsed houses is pictured in El Galpón, Salta province, yesterday. A magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck northwest Argentina, the US Geological Survey reported, leaving at least one person dead and damaging homes. Salta Governor Juan Manuel Urtubey visited the town and promised repair works.  A magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck Salta province yesterday, killing one woman, injuring at least 30 people and extensively damaging the town of El Galpón.  The earthquake hit the town of El Galpón, which is roughly 170 kilometres by road from the provincial capital and 50 kilometres from the epicentre of the earthquake, at 8:33 in the morning yesterday, causing roofs to collapse. Ninety-four-year-old Alberta Flores was killed by a falling beam while she slept. Local doctors reported that 30 others were treated for minor cut and scrapes.  Salta Governor Juan Manuel Urtubey rushed to the town, promising to help reconstruct damaged homes and buildings and confirming that 15 families have been evacuated to the town hall as a precaution against collapse. Urtubey and his Cabinet made the trip to a town where 7,000 residents live after Mayor Héctor Romero appealed for assistance on local radio.  “We don’t have water, the power is out, what we are living through is terrible,” said Romero to the Cadena 3 radio station.  “I was at home and I felt a strong movement and noise, I got my kids out of the house — which also suffered damage to the roof — I went outside and saw that the school had been destroyed. Thank God this was on a Saturday because if not, it would have taken all of the kids.”  Urtubey has ordered that a damage assessment be carried out so that works can start tomorrow. He also said that even though the situation was under control, the province’s medical helicopter was available for the residents of El Galpón if necessary.  In addition to the multiple brick buildings that came down as a result of the tremor, there were reports of damage to the local hospital. Images and video from the town featured bricks scattered across the pavement and shattered walls teetering perilously.  The 5.9 quake lasted for approximately 15 seconds and was reported to have taken place 10 kilometres underground and was felt in neighbouring provinces such as Jujuy, Tucumán, Catamarca, Santiago del Estero and even parts of Chaco province according to the DyN news agency.  Northern Argentina commonly experiences low-intensity earthquakes but yesterday’s was the third this calendar year in Salta with an intensity of at least 5 on the Richter scale.  Argentina’s most destructive earthquake dates back to 1944, killing 10,000 people in the province of San Juan and wiped out large sections of the provincial capital. 27\n",

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warned the storm remained \"very serious\" and urged the public in affected areas to remain indoors amid the threat of flooding and high winds, which have brought down trees and caused some damage to homes.

Around 33,000 households in the area are now without power, she said, warning that this number was likely to grow as the day progresses.  \"It is still a dangerous cyclone.

      "Fire authorities say a final figure of 116 homes have been destroyed by a bushfire that could burn all summer  The number of homes destroyed in the Wye River fire on Victoria’s Great Ocean Road on Christmas Day has risen to 116.  Country Fire Authority deputy incident controller Mark Gunning said 116 houses in Wye River and Separation Creek had been destroyed in the 2200-hectare blaze.  “That will probably be the final number, as we’ve just completed an extensive search,” Gunning said on Saturday evening.  The fire swept through bushland and began to advance toward the town of Lorne on Friday night.    And the emergency management commissioner, Craig Lapsley, said the blaze could continue burning until January or February. Even a dousing of rain on Saturday was unlikely to do much in the long term once the state began to dry out. “This fire doesn’t go away,” Lapsley said.  Great Ocean Road bushfire: homes destroyed as five towns evacuated Read more  More than 300 firefighters spent the night fighting the fire after the town of Lorne was evacuated on Friday evening. Residents were told they could go home after an evacuation recommendation was lifted shortly after 9am on Saturday.  The nearby townships of Wye River, Separation Creek, Kennett River and Grey River were evacuated earlier on Friday afternoon. Emergency warnings remain in place for Wye River and Separation Creek, and both areas remained closed on Saturday afternoon.  “Power is out, though fallen domestic solar power lines remain a threat,” a Country Fire Authority notice said.    “There are a number of hazardous tress that have been burnt and are dangerous, and damage to septic systems can result in leaking sewerage and health hazards.”    Crews were also assessing the full extent of property damage in area.    Watch and act alerts were in place for Lorne, Allenvale, Kennett River and Grey River on Saturday.      Lapsley said on Saturday morning: “Obviously we are very pleased to see the emergency warning lifted for Lorne, and that means VicRoads and VicPol can now go about restoring roads so people can access all the way down the coast to Lorne.    “However, the roads from Lorne south will be closed for days until VicRoads and others, local government, do their assessments of the roads to ensure they are safe and until they are safe people won’t be able to access that area.  “Those people in Wye River and Separation Creek that have lost properties, we’ll do our best in the next 24 hours to get those people back in to have a look at the damage, the impact and destruction that this fire has caused.”  Lapsley said strong local winds on Friday had blown embers over control lines – something that had only been expected to happen on a much hotter, windier day – but the response was well planned.  “That plan played out. It was actioned just before lunchtime on Christmas Day where the community were told to evacuate. And they did that in a very orderly way.  “We always say that primacy of life is the critical issue in the state particularly after the royal commission [into the] fires of 2009. That’s the direct result of why we haven’t lost life for what is a very intense fire yesterday … [people] walked away from the fire that had every potential to be a killer.”  Daniel Andrews, the state premier, said Victorians were “opening up their homes” and assisting people who had “not had a very good Christmas at all – people who are out of their homes, out of their areas and doing it tough at the moment. The very best comes out at the very worst of times.    “This is really a very challenging fire – but in the planning and the execution and indeed in terms of the outcomes, no person has been harmed. That’s something that we can be very proud of.  “It will be a very difficult few days, though, indeed many weeks, for those who have lost their homes, or at least have lost a premises. I can confirm that 35 houses are gone in Wye River, 18 are gone in Separation Creek. And the fire stopped just some 500 metres short of Kennett River. There would have been several more losses if it had kept going.”  Weather over the next few days has been predicted to be favourable for firefighting, with rain and lower temperatures.  The main firefront had not gone through Kennett River, but firefighters defending homes there had put out spot fires and no properties had been reported burnt.  Holidaymakers were being advised on Saturday to stay away, and those away from their homes were told not to return yet.  The Great Ocean Road remained closed from Bellbrae to Skenes Creek on Saturday morning but was reopened between Torquay and Lorne.  Community meetings were due to be held at lunchtime on Saturday at relief centres in Apollo Bay and Torquay.  Organisers of the Falls music festival, due to be held near Lorne from Monday, were due to meet fire authorities at noon on Saturday to discuss whether it could go ahead.    “The township of Lorne is now being evacuated, the Falls farm itself is safe from the path of the fires,” a statement on festival’s website said.    “We are working with the CFA, fire authorities and emergency services to stay across the current situation.”    The festival is scheduled to begin on Monday and run until New Year’s Day.  The Bureau of Meteorology predicted a top of 18C at Lorne on Boxing Day and up to 20mm of rain.   38\n",
      "PRAGUE—Thousands were forced from their homes and at least 10 people were killed as floodwaters deluged swathes of Europe on Monday, including the historic center of the Czech capital Prague.  Shops and schools were shut and road and rail transports were disrupted across the Czech Republic, Austria and Germany following torrential rains.  The flooding caused chaos at Prague Zoo where around 1,000 animals were moved to higher ground after the Vltava river burst its banks late Sunday.  ADVERTISEMENT  Zookeepers had to tranquilize tigers and other large animals in a dramatic overnight operation.  “It’s a terrifying feeling to experience this all over again,” Petr Velensky, the zoo’s reptile specialist, told AFP, recalling how many animals drowned in a 2002 flood.  Czech rescue crews were searching for four more people believed to have died in floodwaters that cut power to tens of thousands of households.  The heavy rainfall has triggered nightmarish memories of the 2002 floods that killed dozens in the region including 17 in the Czech Republic alone.  The Czech government declared a state of emergency Sunday, deploying 2,000 troops in its rescue drive as more than 8,000 people were evacuated from their homes, officials said.  A house collapse claimed two lives south of Prague, while an electrician was killed trying to switch off a transformer as a precaution, a woman perished when she was hit by a falling tree branch and three men drowned in rivers or drains around the country, police said.  “You realize here what nature can do. How helpless we really are despite having all our technology,” Prague pensioner Helena Holubova said, watching the water rise from a bridge over the Vltava in central Prague.  With Prague’s 14th-century Charles Bridge under threat, a 25-ton excavator was at work throughout the day Monday to remove debris piling up around the structure.  ADVERTISEMENT  Nikol Voborilova, a worker at a riverside restaurant in Prague, told AFP: “We are closed for now, we’ve moved the equipment out and we have 30-40 centimeters (12 to 16 inches) of water inside.”  The river was expected to peak in the capital on Tuesday.  Thousands of households were hit with power outages, while fallen trees snarled rail traffic across western regions of the Czech Republic, where chemical plants were also shut down as a precaution to prevent dangerous spills seen in 2002.  Flooding also deluged neighboring Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Two people were reported dead in Austria and another person died in Switzerland.  “We’re in shock. We had to leave home in the blink of an eye,” a woman in the eastern German city of Dresden which had been severely damaged in 2002 told the NTV channel.  She and her baby spent the night at a community center, like thousands of others evacuated in the eastern region of Saxony, where rescue efforts by police and soldiers were being hampered by power outages.  Some 2,500 people were evacuated from hard-hit Grimma, near Leipzig.  Two people were reported missing in Germany.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel was due to visit flood-hit regions Tuesday.  In Austria, two people were killed in flooding and close to 1,000 were evacuated as landslides threatened their homes, mostly around the western city of Salzburg and in the north.  Authorities in Austria warned that the Danube and the Inn rivers could surpass levels from 2002, when the country suffered up to 7.5 billion euros ($9.8 billion) in damage.  Water levels on the Danube, Inn and Ilz rivers, which meet in the German city of Passau, have already surpassed records from 2002 and 1954.  “A lot of people who already had to cope with major flooding in 2002 are refusing to leave their homes,” Passau mayor Juergen Duppen told Germany’s N24 TV channel.—Jan Flemr 39\n",

      "By KHRISNA VIRGIL  Tribune Staff Reporter  kvirgil@tribunemedia.net  PRIME Minister Perry Christie said yesterday the government plans to simultaneously rebuild the hurricane-ravaged Family Islands where an estimated 836 homes were completely destroyed.  Mr Christie said based on information from the Department of Social Services, Hurricane Joaquin wiped out 413 homes in Long Island, 227 houses in San Salvador, 123 homes in Acklins, 50 houses in Crooked Island and 23 residences in Rum Cay.  However, Mr Christie suggested that the numbers could increase as teams continue to assess the damage to homes and provide assistance to impacted and displaced families.  Last week, the nation’s leader said an initial estimate of the costs of damage due to Hurricane Joaquin was already at $60m and was expected to rise as the additional assessments came into the Ministry of Finance.  While he has stated the government will most likely borrow money to assist with rebuilding, he revealed yesterday that the government has received grants to assist with the effort. The most recent grant was $1.7m from the Japanese government through its Japanese Aid Programme.  The prime minister yesterday spoke about this matter in the House of Assembly and the progress made on the southern and central islands since the passage of the category four storm earlier this month.  “This is a continuing exercise,” Mr Christie said, “and based on their (the assessors) findings, the government will respond in kind as a part of the work of the National Restoration and Recovery Unit. This will be done in the shortest possible time as the primary consideration of my government is to house and restore the physical comforts of our citizens.”  He continued: “Mr Speaker, I have met personally with the leaders of these teams, the engineers from the Ministry of Works and all the technical people of the government with the view to indicating that the intention of the government, Mr Speaker, which is to restore these matters in the shortest possible time and that we want to have a comprehensive approach to restoration, not one island at a time, but all islands at the same time.  “So, Mr Speaker, I expect as these teams come in that works will commence, in fact work has already commenced on some islands.”  The Department of Housing, he said, has provided designs of houses constructed following previous hurricanes, however, the foundation designs have to be adjusted to account for higher flood levels experienced during Hurricane Joaquin. Local contractors will be given the opportunity to construct the homes in the various Family Islands.  Mr Christie said as the efforts begin, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has purchased five “homes on wheels” that can each accommodate three adults or two adults and two children. Additionally seven mobile trailer homes were procured that are able to accommodate six to 10 persons.  The temporary units will be assigned to families and government employees on the affected islands who have been displaced due to the destruction of their homes or rental units while the construction of permanent replacements are completed.  Telecommunications  Immediately after the passage of Hurricane Joaquin, BTC discovered that 59 of its cell sites were off line that negatively affected 59 communities in the central and southern islands.  However, over the last two weeks, BTC has been able to restore services to all islands except south Long Island where two cell sites are down in the settlements of Roses and Mortimer’s. This is due to downed poles that are hindering the restoration of normal services, Mr Christie said.  He said at the moment there are no fixed Internet services to the south of Clarence Town, but work is continuing.  In Acklins, all sites are still down and dishes have been destroyed. Mr Christie said in Lovely Bay residents are able to make cellular calls using the site at Crooked Island. Also in Long Cay the dish on the cell tower needs to be re-aligned.  Family Island airports  The Department of Civil Aviation, Mr Christie said, has confirmed that all airports in the islands affected by Hurricane Joaquin are open for normal operations, although some terminal buildings suffered damage.  The last to be re-opened was Deadman’s Cay Airport in Long Island, which was opened for service on October 9.  He said the Department of Civil Aviation is continuing to carry out assessments on the conditions of the airports in the affected areas with a view towards any immediate remediation that may be necessary.  Social Services  In the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, Mr Christie said the Department of Social Services deployed four teams consisting of 14 social workers to conduct rapid initial damage assessments and assist with distribution of food and water to the severely affected islands.  The team deployed to Rum Cay conducted assessments on 29 homes, but were unable to process any of the winter residents whose homes may have been affected. He said the social workers are still compiling data on the number of residents by gender – this includes 10 school age children.  In San Salvador the team assessed 216 homes and counted 62 unoccupied homes. There are 227 students on the island, however, five have relocated to the capital.  During assessments in Crooked Island, the department processed 25 homes. Sixteen people remain in the clinic, as their homes are inhabitable.  There are seven homes remaining in Long Cay, which had 24 persons.  Mr Christie said long-term accommodations need to be identified for them along with the other residents whose homes were destroyed or severely damaged.  In Acklins, social workers completed 107 assessments. This does not include the persons whose homes were destroyed. They are in the process of compiling their data.  A team was deployed for Long Island on October 5. The team reported that the island was severely damaged which resulted in many homes being destroyed.  Mr Christie said it was difficult for the social workers to obtain an accurate count of all the families and homes that were affected by Hurricane Joaquin. However, they continue to process and compile information on the number of men, women and children affected.  Mr Christie said with respect to the restoration and recovery of vital state owned infrastructure, the Ministry of Works and its Urban Planning Department has completed its initial survey of damage, including roads, causeways and bridges and other government installations, including schools, clinics, and official residences.  He said he was in the process of analysing this report to decide on further action.  Staff from the Ministry of Housing are currently reviewing the assessments and compiling lists of building materials required for repairs in the affected islands.  Mr Christie said NEMA is also sourcing building materials which will be shipped to the Family Islands to be distributed to persons who have requested and qualified for assistance with building materials only or for building materials and labour.  The Royal Bahamas Defence Force will assist with some of the smaller repairs and NEMA is compiling a list of contractors and skilled construction craftsmen in the various Family Islands who will be able to assist with labour for repairs.  The technical staff of the Disaster Recovery and Reconstruction Unit with the help of other government agencies is compiling the list of homes that will have to be constructed to accommodate those persons whose homes were destroyed and have no source of permanent shelter.  Mr Christie said it is expected that there will be a close liaison between all of these engineering teams to ensure that there is no overlapping and more importantly that nothing falls between the cracks. 41\n",

      "El número de personas fallecidas por el deslizamiento de un cerro en el departamento boliviano de Cochabamba (centro) a causa de las lluvias se elevó a 14, entre ellos varios niños, informaron hoy fuentes oficiales.    El alcalde de Morochata, Juan Vegamonte, señaló que las víctimas son ya 14, aunque hasta ahora sólo se han recuperado cuatro cuerpos, uno de ellos el de un pequeño de cuatro años, según un reporte de radio Erbol.    La avalancha se produjo el pasado sábado por la noche en el municipio de Morochata a consecuencia de las intensas lluvias de las últimas semanas, y sepultó numerosas viviendas a las que los equipos de rescate tratan de acceder con gran dificultad, por lo que aún no se han recuperado los cuerpos de al menos diez personas.    Entre los sepultados hay otros seis niños, según la secretaria de los Derechos de la Madre Tierra en Cochabamba, Cinthia Vargas.    Tareas de rescate van lentas  Las tareas de rescate también se han visto ralentizadas debido a que el terreno aún es inestable y podrían ocurrir nuevos deslizamientos.    Más de diez familias han sido evacuadas por seguridad a otra comunidad de Morochata.    El presidente de Bolivia, Evo Morales, se desplazó esta madrugada a la zona afectada para coordinar las labores de ayuda a los damnificados, anunció por su parte el vicepresidente Álvaro García Linera.    Morales ha sobrevolado las áreas afectadas y aterrizará en Cochabamba si el tiempo lo permite, indicó García Linera a través de un comunicado de la Vicepresidencia.    La temporada de lluvias, que en Bolivia se extiende desde octubre a marzo, ha dejado ya 40 fallecidos, cuatro desaparecidos y casi 47,000 familias afectadas, además de pérdidas millonarias en los sectores agrícola y ganadero.    A esas cifras se suman ahora las 14 víctimas mortales por el derrumbe del cerro en Morochata.    El departamento más afectado por las intensas precipitaciones es el de Cochabamba, seguido por los de Chuquisaca, Potosí, La Paz, Beni, Santa Cruz y Pando. 53\n"

The city's Civil Protection department said Monday that about 100 homes were underwater. Rescuers evacuated an elderly woman but are complaining that many residents are refusing evacuation.  Bosnians have still not recovered from the devastating floods in May, the worst in 120 years. The flooding displaced 90,000 people from their homes and left 43,000 homes in need of repair.

The weather followed a cold front that passed over the states of Santa Catarina and Paraná, which brought strong winds with the rain. Paraná state has been the worst affected, where ten people have been killed and six were reported missing. Over 130 cities have been affected by the disaster and it was estimated that 40,000 people were evacuated.  Of particular concern was the Paraná River, which burst its banks in places. The rising water level on the river also caused flooding in neighbouring Argentina, and the floodgates at the Yacyreta Dam were opened on 11 June to help control the floodwaters. The dam is located on the border of Argentina, and it was reported that record levels of water passed through the dam.  Floodwaters and landslides have blocked some roads and destroyed bridges, cutting off easy access to some of the affected towns.  The rain was forecast to finish on 15 June, leaving emergency workers with the task of recovering from the flooding. 61\n",

      "TORONTO – The City of Calgary says only a small number of buildings may still be without power in the downtown core after last week’s devastating floods in southern Alberta that left three dead.  Officials say some structures may not yet have power because of specific electrical or other issues that need to be resolved first and officials say work will continue to restore electrical service to a number of residential neighbourhoods that were also hard hit by flooding.  In Medicine Hat, inspectors will carry on checking homes Wednesday as thousands of homeowners were forced out as a precaution when levels rose dramatically on the South Saskatchewan River.  Owners are being urged to clean their properties if they encounter problems to avoid health concerns.  In dozens of neighbourhoods in flood-ravaged Alberta communities, thousands of volunteers are helping residents struggling to clean up and around their homes. On Monday, approximate 2,500 people showed up at McMahon Stadium in Calgary alone, ready to help strangers.  Earlier this week, Alberta Environment officials said it has completed or is working to implement 13 of the 18 recommendations contained in the flood mitigation report that was presented to the government in 2006.  The work has included mapping the flood risk of 90 rivers and streams.  As residents continue to clean up after the flood, here’s a brief “by the numbers” look at the Alberta floods (please note: numbers below are subject to constant change):  100,000 to 120,000 – The number of people that were forced out of their homes across Alberta due to the floods.  75,000 – Estimated number of Calgarians that were evacuated last week. 10,000 are still waiting to return home.  2,000 – Number of Calgary evacuees still housed in emergency centres or dormitories.  75,000 – Number of citizens who had to flee high water from the Bow and Elbow rivers after last week’s floods.  22- Number of confirmed local states of emergency as of June 25.  10 – The number of years it could take to rebuild the communities in flood affected areas in Alberta.  22 – Number of active local Emergency Operations Centres in southern Alberta.  13,000 to 15,000 – Number of residents evacuated from High River in Alberta.  80 – Percentage of High River that remained without services and the waste-water treatment plant wasn’t working as of Monday.  11,000 – Number of homes and businesses still out of power in Calgary.  9 – Number of community support centres being opened around flood zones Wednesday.  300 – Approximate number of people who ignored the High River evacuation order.  5 – Number of Alberta Search and Rescue teams working with emergency responders in affected communities.  31 – Number of communities directly affected by the floods. Find out the latest info here.  1,000 – Approximate number of homes that were hit by high water in Medicine Hat. Nearly 10,000 residents in that city were forced to head for higher ground.  1,200 – Approximate number of Siksika First Nation residents that were evacuated due to heavy flooding along the Bow River.  1,500 – Number of people registered at Medicine Hat’s emergency centre as of Sunday June 24. Accommodation had been provided for about 600 displaced residents.  $1,000,000,000 – The amount of money the province of Alberta has approved to kick-start flood recovery.  $3 to $5 billion – Initial flood damage estimates according to preliminary report from BMO analyst Tom MacKinnon. BMO predicts 25 per cent will not be covered by insurance.  $1,250 – The amount of money given to displaced adults who qualify for a pre-loaded debit card in order to help with their immediate housing needs and day-to-day purchases. $500 will be given per eligible child.  $400 million – The damage cost of the last major flood to hit Calgary in 2005. 75\n",
      "Wildfires have forced evacuations in two Alberta communities and in the B.C. interior.  Emergency alerts have been issued for Nordegg and Lodgepole in Alberta because two separate fires are burning within a few kilometres of each community, and a rapidly growing fire in central B.C. has forced the evacuations of about 50 homes.  Between 40 and 250 people were affected by the wildfires in Nordegg, Alta., an official said. (Courtesy Clearwater County Twitter, @clearwtrcnty)  The fire near Nordegg, 200 kilometres southwest of Edmonton, has been burning for several days with residents on a one-hour evacuation notice since Thursday.  The fire grew overnight reaching more than 300 hectares.  Duncan MacDonnell with Alberta Sustainable Resource Development said crews had the fire contained, but officials were still poised to issue an evacuation order if the blaze broke through any containment points.  MacDonnell said the fire near Lodgepole, which is about 100 kilometres southwest of Edmonton, is new.  Wildfire information officers with the province said late Sunday that as the sun set and winds died down, the situation with both fires appeared to be calming down and their spread was slowing.  About 100 Nordegg residents were forced from their homes.  About 140 people from Lodgepole registered at the evacuation centre in Drayton Valley. Displaced residents said they couldn't believe how quickly the situation escalated.  \"Next thing I hear was the siren,\" said Gail Tkaczyk. \"And it's the police officer coming down the driveway and we've got to go. No time to think twice.\"  \"You don't have enough time to really think properly,\" said Evangeline Braun. \"Grabbed my dog and it was get on the road. That was that quick. So there wasn't much time at all.\"  Braun said the volunteers at the evacuation centre have been kind and helpful. \"I want to say thank you to all of them,\" she said.  1,260 hectares burn near Lodgepole  Roughly 1,260 hectares were burning in the fire near Lodgepole by early Monday evening as winds had pushed the blaze towards the community.  About 120 firefighters were on the ground, with more expected on Tuesday.  The fire was considered \"laying low\" as of Monday at noon, but firefighters remained concerned the winds could pick up in the afternoon.  Residents living a few miles east of Lodgepole near Highway 620 and Range Road 90 are taking in stride a one-hour evacuation alert.  \"Nothing we haven't seen before,\" said Ken Newby as he continued doing chores around the yard, noting there was less smoke than yesterday.  George Cook said he \"didn't think it was anything to be concerned about,\" leaving for work as usual in Drayton Valley Monday morning.  Alberta issued a fire weather advisory for the province Sunday, saying that high winds and dry temperatures made the likelihood of uncontrolled wildfires high.  Residents of Nordegg are being told to go to Rocky Mountain House about 100 kilometres east of the community.  Lodgepole residents are being told to go to Drayton Valley, which is about 50 kilometres away.  Last week, a provincial official said conditions in some areas were similar to May 2011 when flames roared through the town of Slave Lake, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing thousands of people to flee. The wildfire caused an estimated $1 billion in damage, including firefighting and relief costs.  In B.C., the 1,100-hectare Spatsum Creek fire, west of Kamloops and about 20 kilometres south of Ashton, has more than doubled in size since Saturday as winds have fanned the flames.  Kevin Skrepnek, spokesman for the B.C. Wildfire Management Branch, says hot weather has caused an increase in the number of wildfires this year. There have already been 177 wildfires in the province since April 1 — all but two have been caused by human error. 76\n",

      "1. Frost Quakes  Much of southern and eastern Ontario and Quebec was abuzz between Christmas and the first week of January after hearing, hearing about or feeling loud banging noises and tremors. Police and media were inundated with calls from the worried to the curious about what most thought were falling trees, sonic booms, gunshots or earthquake activity. In actual fact, they were experiencing what scientists called cryoseisms or “frost quakes” that are the result of freezing water splitting deep soil or rock or causing frost heaving. The sudden expansion of the water in frozen soil or rocks puts stress on the ground and the ensuing cracking, vibrating and booming noise can easily be mistaken for earthquakes and gunshots. Frost quakes are louder if the ground is saturated from previous rains, snowmelt or flooding and there is little snow cover to muffle the sound. They are best heard between midnight and dawn when sound travels better in cold air, there is less background noise and winds are lighter.  2. Freezing Rain Frightens Torontonians  An intensifying low over Arkansas brought 15 to 20 cm of snow east of Lake Huron and significant freezing rain to areas north of lakes Erie and Ontario over January 5-6. Residents in the Greater Toronto Area were especially nervous about the possible repeat of the pre-Christmas ice storm they had just weathered. What they got instead was a brief shot of freezing rain, with hardly any accretion on trees or hydro lines but enough of a coating to make roads treacherous during the commute. Adding to the misery was a dramatic drop in temperature by 17 degrees that created a flash freeze and black ice.  3. Province-wide Whiteouts  A surprise, fast-moving wall of snow caused highway havoc right across southern Ontario on February 27. Huge pileups – three 30-vehicle messes in southwestern Ontario alone – and white-knuckle driving were typical scenes. North of Toronto there was a 96-vehicle pileup on Highway 400. Amid blinding snow, the OPP closed all roads in Huron, Bruce and Perth counties, which led to a kind of reverse snow day as kids were left stuck at school overnight or billeted out.  4. Spring Flooding in First Nations Communities  The threat of rising flood waters on the Albany River and sewer back-ups forced the evacuation of 2,000 residents in the northern Ontario First Nation communities of Kashechewan and Attawapiskat around May 11, where 40 homes and buildings were damaged by sewage and flood waters. In total, eight communities in Ontario’s far north came under states of emergency, including Moosonee, mostly due to rising waters.  5. Another Two-Tornado Day  On June 24 at around 3:30 p.m., an EF1 tornado moved through the community of Laurel Station to the northwest of Orangeville. Peak winds associated with the tornado were between 135 and 175 km/h – strong enough to move a residential vehicle three metres, un-roof a few homes and down several trees. A half-hour later another EF1 tornado struck east of Tottenham. The twister prompted several road closures and damaged a riding stable where it killed a horse.  6. Burlington Rain Gusher  A band of thunderstorms generating massive rains developed in a line from Freelton to Burlington late on August 4. While rainfall amounts of 100 to 150 mm were estimated by radar, an amateur weather observer recorded a highly localized amount of 190 mm – a two-month supply – in four hours. The heavy rain flooded basements and intersections and forced the closure of many roads including Highways 403, 407 and the Queen Elizabeth Way, or QEW. On some roads water reached above the roofs of vehicles, forcing motorists and passengers to swim to safety. The deluge backed up storm drains, caused mudslides and creeks to overflow, and left standing water on 300 properties and in 500 basements. Burlington’s Mayor claimed it was the worst flooding he’d seen in 20 years. Illustrative of how targeted Burlington was, Hamilton recorded no rain, 3 mm fell at Toronto Pearson, Toronto Island got 1 mm and Vineland received 1.3 mm. Damages from flooding were estimated in excess of $90 million.  7. August Deluges in Windsor  A slow-moving storm crossed the Detroit River into Canada on August 11. Torrential downpours in excess of 70 mm over a 10-hour span fell in Windsor and district, filling basements and swamping yards and streets. It was a month’s worth of rain and the second-highest rain total ever recorded at the airport during August. About a week later, another powerful storm ripped through Windsor bringing down huge tree branches and tossing around backyard gazebos that were bolted down in concrete. An Environment Canada storm team later confirmed that at least two EF0 tornadoes touched down − the first in south Windsor and the second northeast of Harrow.  8. Not Buffalo-Sized Snows  Strong cold winds and relatively warm waters off the Great Lakes combined to produce intense snow squalls on November 19-20. The strongest affected regions were near Georgian Bay where the weather system remained nearly stationary for several hours, dumping snow amounts of 90 cm near Parry Sound, 40 cm in Huntsville, and 20 cm in Bracebridge and Barrie. While the numbers were impressive, they had nothing on the close to 200+ cm that fell in similar lake-effect storms over Buffalo, New York. Back in Ontario, multiple collisions on Highway 400 north of Toronto blocked north-south lanes south of Barrie, causing lengthy delays.  9. Down On the Farm  By late September, it was highly unusual to see fields of Ontario corn and soybeans still unharvested. September also featured twice the usual amount of rain, which kept good field and harvest days to a minimum. Fortunately, in late September and October, Ontario experienced warmer weather that allowed the harvest to progress. Still, in mid-November – with early winter cold, snow and winds − half of Ontario’s grain crop remained in the ground. The Ontario Ministry of Food and Agriculture said it was the latest harvest over a broad area of the province since 1992 – so late that the delayed corn harvest cut into winter wheat planting.  10. November Gales  Unseasonably warm air from Texas, along with powerful 100 km/h winds, whipped through Ontario on November 24 leaving 87,000 hydro customers in the dark. In some places between Windsor and Kingston, trees were ripped right out of the ground – roots and all. Just prior to the warmth and winds came heavy rains that flooded streets and forced road closures. Temperatures soared between St. Catharines and Ottawa to record heights, including 21°C in Cornwall. Blowing winds broke hydro poles, felled trees, shattered bus shelters and left traffic lights dangling. 78\n"

      "For the past several years, flooding has been the big story across the Prairie provinces. In 2005, torrential rains produced summer flooding. In 2011, it was the combination of snowmelt and ice jamming that created a massive billion-dollar disaster across Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Last year, the coincidence of rapid snowmelt and heavy spring rains in southern Alberta generated the most disruptive, destructive and expensive flood in Canadian history – a $6 billion flood of floods. Unfortunately, anyone looking for a break in 2014 was sorely disappointed. This time water problems prevailed across the eastern Prairies just a week before summer began. Excessive rains on soggy ground − too much rain too fast over too many days – led to huge flooding and another billion-dollar disaster.  ©Environment Canada  On June 15, two major slow-moving weather systems, hours apart and more typical of spring or fall, combined to bring a few soggy days to the eastern Prairies. The prolonged moisture-laden storms moved up from the northern United States and stalled near the Saskatchewan-Manitoba border. Relentless rains turned into biblical-sized deluges over three days. Almost a year’s worth of rain fell in some places. Prior to the soaking, three weeks of wet weather meant that the latest rains had nowhere to go but overland. With soil saturated and ditches filled, the water cascaded into channels that rapidly fed into creeks and rivers.  Excess precipitation in the days and weeks leading up to July 1 included:  The third wettest spring on record dating back to 1892 for Saskatoon. Total spring (April to June) precipitation was 230 mm or 175 per cent of normal.  Yorkton had 252 mm of rain in June, which was more than triple the normal accumulation and the wettest ever since 1884 when record-keeping began. Nine days in June had more than 10 mm (normal is 2 days) and spring rainfall totalled 357 mm – another record.  With observations at Brandon dating back to the 1890s, June 2014 was the wettest month ever with 252 mm – three times June’s normal total and, incredibly, 34 mm higher than the all-time previous wettest month of August 1980. June had four days with rainfall over 25 mm, including 75 mm on June 19, and three days in a row on the final weekend of the month – all on top of it being Brandon’s wettest spring on record.  One Regina weather site recorded 198 mm of rain in June, which is nearly triple the normal of 70 mm and almost the wettest month on record. Total April-to-June rainfall was 312 mm or 216 per cent of normal, and the second wettest such period with records dating back to 1883.  To the far west, Lethbridge recorded its wettest June and wettest month ever with 280 mm of rain, which is more rain than the city gets in an average year.  ©Environment Canada  Rains and subsequent flooding at the end of June forced the closure of a hundred highways, including a stretch of the TransCanada east of Regina where dozens of bridges, culverts and utilities were washed away and dozens of basements were filled. Sections of country roads were under water for days on end. The rains also led to record flows on 17 southern Manitoba rivers and streams. Nearly 100 communities, including the cities of Melville and Yorkton in Saskatchewan, declared states of emergency. Citizen volunteers and a thousand military reservists scrambled to fill hundreds of thousands of sandbags to fend off rising floodwaters. Some 1,000 residents, mainly in southwestern Manitoba, were displaced and faced mucky basements and debris-strewn yards on their return home.  ©Environment Canada  Flooded pastures resembled rice paddies and crop fields featured lakes with whitecaps, leaving some of the best farmland in Canada too soggy to farm. Farmers feared losing their growing season altogether. In Manitoba and Saskatchewan, well over one million acres of seeded fields were flooded or drowned and another two million were left unseeded. As much as six million acres of farmland in the west were damaged, drowned or lying on still-frozen ground. Even though some crops recovered from flooding, their high yields suffered. Total costs from flooding exceeded $1 billion as farmers lost crops and communities mopped up. Weeks later, waves of mosquitoes emerged from the sodden ground and standing waters. Hardship was especially prevalent in several First Nations communities where flooding is becoming a ritual that brings both emotional and physical health issues.  The seeds of this summer’s flood started in the fall of 2013, when already saturated soils, combined with high over-winter snowfall covered the eastern Prairies. It was magnified by an exceptionally hard winter with a deep snowpack and a late spring melt that kept soils saturated and potholes filled. Another factor leading to worsening Prairie flooding in recent years that has been brought to light by expert hydrometeorologists is altered drainage patterns on agricultural lands in Saskatchewan and Manitoba and the greater incidence of multi-day rainfalls. Storm rainfalls over larger areas are lasting longer than usual. The network of Prairie potholes and sloughs has already filled to the brim, and now the runoffs are moving overland in a “fill and spill process” that is ripping out roads, inundating homes and overwhelming sewer networks. Ducks Unlimited said that wetland drainage on the Prairies has increased average flows by more than 60 per cent, and a study by the University of Saskatchewan found changes in wetland drainage over 50 years increased recent flood peaks by as much as 32 per cent. 79\n",
      "ESSA TWP. – Victims of the June tornado which tore through Angus don't qualify for provincial funding under the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program.  Essa Township Mayor Terry Dowdall received a letter to that effect from the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing earlier this month.  “Unfortunately, the province said with our ability to pay and the state of the municipality, because it is in good shape, that we can just afford to eat that,” Dowdall said. “I'm quite disappointed. I know Premier (Kathleen) Wynne was up here. She saw the devastation, the damage.”  The June 17 tornado whipped through Essa Township around the supper hour, leaving 100 families homeless while others had to clean up downed trees and debris.  The EF2 tornado left a 13-kilometre track of destruction - beginning in south Angus, crossing Essa Township and eventually ending due east in the Essa and Athabaska roads area of south Barrie. An EF2 tornado can blow off roofs and uproot trees with wind speeds of 180 to 220 kilometres an hour.  Within hours of the storm, Dowdall had declared a state of emergency and brought in Essa Township emergency departments staff, as well Simcoe County administrators, to assist the 300 people displaced by the storm.  Dowdall said approximately $140,000 has been raised by the community for disaster relief, and he was hoping for two-to-one provincial funding, but would have accepted one-to-one.  Intead, Essa is getting none-to-one.  “We all pitch in, we all pay for part of that fund, all Ontarians, and there certainly was enough damage up here that I think council was of the belief, and the residents were of the belief, that the province should have came forward,” Dowdall said.  “I'm kind of at a bitter loss for words how they don't see even one-to-one funding, to help out these residents, to get their lives back on track.”  A letter from Ontario Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Ted McMeekin said the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program is designed to restore essential municipal infrastructure or private property to its pre-disaster condition, so communities can get back on their feet.  Factors include the nature and impact of the disaster on the community, the municipality's ability to pay for damage repairs and the degree of insurance coverage.  “I understand that most of the residents impacted by the tornado had insurance coverage and your excellent fund-raising efforts will be able to support those few residents in your community who may have uninsured losses,” said McMeekin in the letter.  Essa Township was also looking for approximately $55,000 in municipal damages, which Dowdall said was to pay for staff overtime associated with the tornado.  That request was turned down too.  “As these costs represent approximately 1% of your tax revenue this seems well within the ability of the municipality to manage,” McMeekin said.  “We weren't asking for the world. I was a bit shocked,” Dowdall said of the ministry's rejection. “It certainly took a little bit of the wind out of the sails.”  He said Simcoe-Grey MPP Jim Wilson is going to raise the matter with the Ontario government.  But Wilson is a Progressive Conservative, and it's a majority Liberal government that Ontarians elected June 12.  “That's part of, probably, the dynamics of our application, perhaps, which I would hope's not the nature,” Dowdall said, “but I guess that's for others to decide, to read into that.  “From my perspective, when I see what they (the province) have spent a lot of money on, this (fund) is something really to help the grassroots people in the community and even $140,000 on one-to-one isn't a lot in the grand scheme of things.”  Dowdall said the only good news from the province's rejection is the money which has been raised can be dispersed. Previously, it had to held to get those matching dollars.  “We're just holding onto it in trust, we're not actually the ones who are going to divvy it up,” he said. “There's a committee that's going to decide how to do that.  “The community just rallied. The businesses and all the residents just rallied to raise this money, with the hopes that the province would match.”  Asked Thursday how much money was in the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program, a Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing spokesman said the government does not have a set budget for it.

      "CHAD (23 Aug.) - Thousands of homes collapsed and schools were damaged in camp Mile for Sudanese refugees in eastern Chad due to heavy rains that struck the region on Thursday.  Sheikh Abbakar Abdullah Al Doum Tajouri, spokesman for the camp’s refugees, told Radio Dabanga that “torrential rains led to the destruction of 2,082 houses. In addition, eight schools were damaged, including desks, books, pamphlets, and stationery. Rains also uprooted 178 trees.”  According to the sheikh, the affected families are currently living in the open. He has asked the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and other agencies to expedite the provision of tents, tarpaulins, blankets, and food.  Heavy rainfall also injured two people, including an elderly woman, in refugee camp Kariari in eastern Chad.  A sheikh told Radio Dabanga that 800 houses were destroyed by rain and that a number of cattle were killed by floods that “washed the region.”  He is calling upon humanitarian organisations to expedite the provision of aid to dozens of families which do not have shelter, food, or medicine. 87\n",

      "Etiquetas  Santiago de Chile, 1 ene.- Un incendio forestal destruyó hoy 24 viviendas y obligó a evacuar un centenar de casas en el cerro San Roque, del puerto chileno de Valparaíso, que además ha dejado varios lesionados y ha arrasado con diez hectáreas de vegetación, informaron las autoridades.  El fuego, de acuerdo con informes preliminares de la policía, habría sido causado por niños que manipulaban fuegos de artificio en ese sector de Valparaíso, a 120 kilómetros al oeste de Santiago.  El gobernador del principal puerto chileno, José Pedro Núñez, señaló que por el momento se está preparando la habilitación de un albergue para las familias damnificadas por el incendio, cuya propagación fue favorecida por el intenso calor reinante en la zona y en general en el centro y norte de Chile.  En el asunto también trabaja la secretaria regional de Desarrollo Social, María de los Ángeles De la Paz, dijo Núñez en declaraciones al canal 24Horas, en las que indicó además que cerca de un centenar de casas han sido evacuadas por precaución.  En el control de las llamas participaron bomberos, brigadas de la Corporación Nacional Forestal (Conaf) y personal municipal, dijo por su parte, al mismo medio, el alcalde de Valparaíso, Jorge Castro.  Al lugar concurrieron también bomberos de algunas localidades cercanas, además de un avión y un helicóptero cuya principal función fue evitar la propagación del fuego.  \"El trabajo ha sido dificultoso porque la parte baja del incendio es una quebrada muy profunda con muy difíciles accesos\", dijo por su parte a los periodistas el director regional de la Oficina Nacional de Emergencia (Onemi), Guillermo de la Maza.  Agregó que unas 25 personas han sido atendidos en puestos médicos de avanzada \"por distintas afectaciones, todas leves\",precisando que hay una persona con heridas por cortes por con trozos de lata y cinco con deficiencias respiratorias, aunque no hay heridos graves.  Entre los lesionados se cuentan también ocho bomberos, pero todos ellos leves, acotó.  La región de Valparaíso ha sido afectada por varios incendios desde el pasado lunes y hoy se mantenían activos, según la policía, focos de fuego en Peñuelas, junto a la autopista que une a Valparaíso con Santiago, en Villa Alemana, en Quintero y en el sector de Belloto Norte del municipio de Quilpué. 92\n",
      "Controlado se encuentra el incendio forestal denominado “La Gruta” ubicado en la comuna de Quilpué, el cual afecta una superficie de 10,6 hectáreas de vegetación. A raíz del incendio se registraron tres personas damnificadas, cinco viviendas destruidas y una desarmaduría con daños. Los damnificados se encuentran en casa de familiares. Dada la cantidad de combustible y las condiciones meteorológicas presente en el sector, se mantiene Alerta Roja para la comuna de Quilpué.  Respecto a las personas de 10 viviendas evacuadas en forma preventiva, fueron trasladados a un recinto dispuesto por el Municipio, y están retornando paulatinamente a sus hogares.  Trabajan en la emergencia CONAF, Bomberos, camiones aljibes Municipales, Carabineros, PDI, Chilquinta, Encargado Comunal y Provincial de Emergencia, Gobernador Provincial (s), Alcalde Municipal y ONEMI Regional.

      "ONEMI se refirió a los 18 incendios activos desde las regiones de Valparaíso a la Araucanía y que han consumido más de 16 mil hectáreas.  Esta mañana el Director Nacional de ONEMI, Ricardo Toro, entregó un nuevo reporte sobre la situación actual de incendios forestales a nivel país y las acciones que se sostienen para su combate y control. A nivel nacional, se registran siete Alertas Rojas para las regiones del Maule, Biobío y La Araucanía; para las provincias de San Antonio, Marga Marga y Melipilla y para las comunas de Valparaíso y San Antonio.  Hasta el momento se reportan 18 incendios activos que abarcan desde las regiones de Valparaíso a la Araucanía, y que comprometen 16 mil 200 hectáreas. Los más complejos son “Santa Zenaida” en la comuna de Angol, en donde hubo peligro de afectación de viviendas pero que fue controlado durante la noche por las medidas tomadas por CONAF y Bomberos logrando asegurar el resguardo del sector, lo mismo ocurrió con el incendio de Ercilla, en la comunidad Temucuicui. Por otra parte, en “El Carrizo”, el más grande en cuanto a la cantidad de hectáreas afectadas, 11 mil entre las regiones Metropolitana y Valparaíso, fueron evacuadas en forma preventiva cinco familias.  “Es necesario destacar que se han desplegado todos los recursos necesarios para cada una de las emergencias: 131 brigadas (CONAF, Bomberos, Ejército y privados), 45 aeronaves, 34 camiones aljibes, 27 técnicos, entre otros; lo que se ha visto reflejado en que no ha habido pérdidas humanas. Además, quiero agradecer a todas las instituciones que componen el Sistema Nacional de Protección Civil, quienes se han esforzado por mantener controlados los incendios”, indicó el Director Nacional de ONEMI.  Finalmente señaló que en comparación al periodo anterior, existe un aumento a la superficie afectada de un 791%, por lo que es necesario extremar las medidas preventivas.  Volver 94\n",

      "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A factory worker is rescued moments before a building is washed away  A landslide has buried between 30 and 40 people in China's Sichuan province following heavy rain, state media say.  Rescue workers with search dogs are at the scene in the city of Dujiangyan, Xinhua news agency reports.  On Tuesday a bridge collapsed in the nearby city of Jiangyou, leaving at least 12 people missing.  Days of heavy rain and floods have damaged hundreds of homes and forced the evacuation of more than 36,000 people in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.  Footage from Chinese state media, meanwhile, showed the dramatic rescue of a factory worker in the town of Deyang, who was stranded by the floods after the factory was washed away.  \"The water level is so high that vehicles, forklifts and excavators have all been washed away,\" Wei Xiao, another factory worker, told Reuters news agency.  Mud and landslides caused by flooding and strong rains are common in China's mountainous areas, killing hundreds of people every year. Deforestation has also made soil erosion much more of a problem.  'Evacuated'  The landslide occurred in the town of Zhongxing is Dujiangyan - one of the places badly hit by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.  The landslide, which covered about 2 sq km (0.8 sq miles), damaged at least 11 homes, Xinhua reported.  \"So far we only know 11 families were buried and more than 200 residents have been evacuated,\" a local official told AFP news agency.  Patrol members in Dujiangyan told local media that by the time they arrived at the scene, a few hours after the landslide, \"everything was already a vast expanse of water\".  Eyewitnesses described stones and debris running down the hill and covering around eight homes in less than three minutes.  Meanwhile, rescue teams have been deployed in Jiangyou to search for those missing after Qinglian bridge collapsed, state media said.  At least six vehicles were reported to have plunged into the river when it came down after days of heavy rain.  Jiangyou's local government say the river volume suddenly increased to a 50-year high on Tuesday.  \"The high levels of flood sediment, and strong and destructive force of the water, caused the Qinglian bridge to collapse,\" it said.  Two other bridges, one in Jiangyou and one in Deyang, were also washed away, officials said.  Chinese officials said that the heavy rain had affected more than 500,000 people in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, damaged about 300 homes, and forced the evacuation of 36,800 people, Xinhua reported.  For the worst affected areas, it appears that there is going to be little respite, says the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing.  Heavy rainfall is forecast in Sichuan province over the next 24 hours, our correspondent adds.  In 2011, more than five million people were reported to be affected by deadly floods in eastern China.  In 2008, Sichuan was hit by a devastating earthquake which led to almost 90,000 people dead or missing. A swollen river has wrecked exhibits at a memorial to those who died. 110\n",

      "JINGGU, Yunnan, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- A candlelight vigil was held early Wednesday morning as the body of 58-year-old Dao Qiongfen lay in a coffin.  Several hours before, the woman, the sole victim so far in a 6.6-magnitude quake that jolted southwest China's Yunnan Province at 9:49 p.m. on Tuesday, was still fast asleep.  \"When it happened, I had been sleeping for half an hour already,\" said Qiongfen's grieving husband, Dao Wenguang, from Mangla Village of Yongping Town, five kilometers away from the epicenter.  Feeling the tremor, Dao Wenguang and their children soon fled the house. \"But I didn't see her, and there was no reply when we called her name,\" the man said.  Dao Qiongfen was later found under a collapsed wall, unable to breathe and her waist broken.  As of 11 a.m. Wednesday, about 13 hours after the earthquake in Jinggu County, Pu'er, at least one person was dead and 324 others were injured, including eight in critical condition.  A total of 124,600 people from five counties and districts were affected, and some 58,980 people were evacuated. The quake also toppled 6,988 buildings and damaged 13,842 more.  In Mangla Village, where many villagers, like Dao, are of the Dai ethnic minority group, a Xinhua reporter saw cracks on buildings. Some adobe walls had collapsed, and broken bricks and tiles were scattered in the streets.  Villagers spent the night outside, and dozens of tents were pitched.  In nearby Mangfei Village, people gathered on a basketball court. They sat around a bonfire during the cold night.  According to Liu Wei, most of the wounded in his village suffered head and shoulder injuries.  SECOND QUAKE  It was the second strong quake to hit the province in a little over two months. A 6.5-magnitude quake with a depth of 12 kilometers struck Ludian County on August 3, killing at least 615 people.  Although the focal depth of Tuesday's quake was relatively shallow at five kilometers and the quake occurred when many were in bed, it appears to have caused fewer casualties than the August quake so far.  Wang Bin, vice head of the Yunnan provincial seismological bureau, said many buildings in the area featured wooden mortise riveting structures, making them relatively quake-proof.  \"In Jinggu, nearly 20,000 out of 60,000 rural households have improved the quality of their houses to meet the standard for shock-resistance,\" said Wang Tianshou, head of the housing and urban-rural development bureau in the county.  The lower intensity of the quake, lower population density in the quake-hit zone, and concentration of residences in flatter, less mountainous areas also led to fewer casualties.  Li Chunguang, head of the science and technology department of the bureau, said the two quakes happened along different seismic belts and had no direct connections.  Li said the province has entered a seismically active period, but further study is needed to predict whether there will be major earthquakes in the near future. 121\n",
      "Update: 6 June, 2014  Situation and response  On 24 and 30 May respectively, 5.6 and 6.1 magnitude earthquakes jolted Yingjiang County in southwest China's Yunnan Province, injuring 45 people. More than 3,000 houses were destroyed and 21,000 severely damaged, while 90,000 houses were moderately damaged, forcing the evacuation of a further 45,000 people. About 210,000 people were affected. The two earthquakes were only 2km apart, which made the damage more severe.  The local government has already arranged for quilts, tents, foldable beds with mattresses and more to be sent to the quake-affected area to meet the basic needs of the quake survivors. Due to the hot weather in the quake zone, mosquitoes can easily grow and spread diseases in the relocation area. Mosquito nets are in urgent need. As there is currently no electricity in the quake zone, lighting at night is a problem which poses a safety issue for the survivors.  Oxfam has been conducting on-site needs assessments in the severely affected townships with the support of our local partners. After the initial assessment, Oxfam’s office in Kunming has collaborated with a partner organisation, the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Center of Yunnan Province, to provide6,000 mosquito nets, 3,000 boxes of mosquito repellent and 3,000 torches to three of the quake-stricken townships in the zone: Kachang, Sudian and Mengnong. These were delivered to survivors by 4 and 5 of June. 122\n",
      "CHANGSHA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rainstorms have killed three people and forced the relocation of more than 54,000 residents after rainstorms hit southern China regions, local authorities said Sunday.  Heavy rains have battered Hunan Province since Thursday, disrupting traffic, power, telecommunications and raising water levels in major rivers and reservoirs, the provincial flood control headquarters said.  A villager in Jinwutang Township was killed in a landslide.  As of 11 a.m. Sunday, the round of heavy rains had affected 461,800 people in 131 townships and destroyed 1,400 housing units in the province.  Local governments have relocated 50,400 people to avoid geological risks from the rainstorms.  In neighboring Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, downpours have left two people dead and affected nearly 200,000 residents, according to the regional department of civil affairs.  As of 5:00 p.m. Sunday, heavy rains had toppled down 522 housing units and seriously damaged another 888 in the region. Direct economic losses were estimated at about 119 million yuan (19 million U.S. dollars).  Local governments have relocated 5,000 residents to safe areas.  As of Sunday noon, power supply had been restored after a rainstorm-triggered flash flood hit Fugong County in southwest China's Yunnan Province, the county publicity department said.  It tore down 14 houses and two bridges, damaging flood-control dikes and inundating a hydropower generation plant.  Local governments in risk-prone areas have relocated residents and allotted them daily necessities.  Shenzhen, a booming town in south China's Guangdong Province, on Sunday experienced its strongest rainfall since 2008, with 2,000 cars submerged in the streets and the operations of more than 5,000 buses suspended.  The city's meteorological bureau issued a red alert for heavy rain, the highest level of the four-tier alert system.  About 130 flights have been canceled at the Shenzhen airport, while another 70 outbound flights have been delayed for more than four hours as of 7:30 p.m. on Sunday evening.  The railway authorities in Shenzhen said they have halted high-speed rail service linking Shenzhen and the provincial capital of Guangzhou.  But no casualties have been reported so far in the city. 123\n",
      "A 5.3-magnitude earthquake in rural southwest China has injured at least 21 people and damaged over 2,000 houses.  The tremors in seismically unstable Yongshan County in Yunnan Province began at 6.40 am local time on Saturday. Authorities say the epicenter of the quake was 13 km below the ground surface.  \"We felt the quake strongly, but it did not last long,\" a local resident recounted to Xinhua news agency.  Authorities say that 2,731 houses have been damaged and 75 have collapsed – mostly shacks made from stamped soil.  21,000 people have been evacuated to tent camps, but electricity and communications are continuing to function normally.  Mountainous Yunnan and bordering Sichuan provinces suffer deadly annual earthquakes, with the 8.0-magnitude 2008 earthquake in Sichuan resulting in the deaths of over 70,000 people.  Larger casualties were avoided this time due to the low population density in the affected area, and the unusually deep epicenter, in a place where tremors usually originate less than 5 km from the surface.  According to Chinese media, some locals have linked the event to the Xiluodu hydropower plant – the second biggest in China – located less than 15 km away. While huge amounts of water stored in rivers above the plants have been known to trigger seismic activity, the government has denied that the latest incident has any connection to the Xiluodu facility, which remains undamaged. 124\n"

      "I. International South Sudan – Conflict and displacement (DG ECHO, UN, media) Fighting in South Sudan has intensified towards the end of the dry season. A government offensive has continued in Jonglei State, the heartland of the main opposition tribe, the Nuer. Government forces now control the villages of Motot, Waat and Walgak. Reports indicate wide-spread destruction. Humanitarian aid workers in the area (approx. 60) were forced to flee to Akobo (close to border with Ethiopia) and later on evacuated from Akobo for security concerns. Due to the ongoing fighting, all humanitarian assistance has been suspended in this area. This could further increase the influx of refugees into Ethiopia where currently around 365 000 South Sudanese refugees are hosted.  Significant ethnic targeting and abuses have been reported in Wau (Western Bahr el Gazal State). The assassination of several senior SPLA commanders led to reprisal attacks against civilians from the Fertit and other non-Dinka groups. 16 000 new arrivals have been recorded in the Wau Protection of Civilians site and 3 000 in the Cathedral site. At the same time, fighting in Raja and attacks by government troops on civilians have resulted in new displacement, presumably towards East Darfur (Sudan).  Fighting has escalated west of Malakal (Upper Nile State) with the government having taken control of Tonga, after days of fighting. Opposition forces are reported to have launched a counter-offensive. Humanitarian agencies have been forced to evacuate from New Fangak in anticipation of a possible attack by government forces using Tonga as the staging ground. Colombia - Land slide (DG ECHO, UNGRD, IDEAM, Colombia Red Cross, Local media) Heavy rains have been affecting several areas of north-western Colombia over the past few days causing landslides.

On 19 April, a total of 86 symptomatic cases of Hepatitis E, including 25 deaths, have been reported in the region. The first sample tests conducted in Dakar, Senegal, confirm the presence of Hepatitis E virus which is a liver disease transmitted through contaminated water.  Diffa Region is affected by the Lake Chad crisis and access to WASH and Health services has been severely limited as a consequence. As of 31 March, more than 242 000 people were displaced in the region according to regional authorities.  Pregnant women and children are the most affected groups among the refugee and IDP populations in particular.  The majority of the cases were registered in the health area of Toumour (Bosso department), but other health centers have also reported cases (Diffa, Kindjandi, Assaga, Maine Soroa and N’guigmi).

      "HANGZHOU/SHANGHAI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The rapid decline of the strength of Typhoon Chan-Hom has given a break to coastal regions in east China, yet local governments are on alert of secondary disasters.  Chan-Hom, the ninth typhoon this year, made landfall on Saturday at 4:40 p.m. in Zhujiajian Township in the island city of Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province.  According to the provincial meteorological station, Chan-Hom, which packed winds of up to 53 meters per second in Dinghai and 49 meters per second in Shipu, downgraded to a tropical storm at 9 a.m. Sunday and left.  Data from the provincial hydrographic office show the average amount of rainfall in Zhejiang reached 77 millimeters from Saturday to Sunday. Ningbo City registered 217 mm of rain and neighboring Yuyao City 322 mm.  No casualties have been reported. A total of 1.92 million people in nine cities have been affected, including more than 1.11 million who were evacuated.  Direct economic losses are estimated at 5.86 billion yuan (940 million U.S. dollars), according to the provincial flood control and drought prevention headquarters.  The worst hit sector is agriculture with economic losses of 3.62 billion yuan, because the typhoon coincided with the picking period of vegetables and melons and wrecked havoc on agricultural facilities, the headquarters said.  Local government warned of water-logging disasters in some cities and torrents in mountainous regions following the record rainfall brought by the typhoon.  As of early Sunday morning, the storm has passed the same latitude as Shanghai about 100 kilometers off the city's coast and moved towards northeast, the municipal meteorological observatory said.  The city government has lifted the warning as rains and winds weakened significantly on Sunday.  According to the city's flood control authority, Shanghai evacuated 163,000 people and called back 3,000 ships to harbor on Saturday, as the city experienced rainstorms of up to 114.6 mm and strong gales of over 30 meters per second.  On Saturday, the typhoon prostrated more than 3,000 trees in Shanghai and forced the city's subway to suspend service on some stretches. More than 1,000 flights have been canceled at the city's two airports.  The neighboring Jiangsu Province also ended the emergency response on Sunday noon after Chan-Hom, which forced more than 78,900 people to be evacuated and 22,423 ships recalled, failed to bring more rain or wind to the province, local flood control and drought prevention headquarters said.  However, many rivers and lakes are still running above the warning water lines, leading to high potential of floods and mudslides, the headquarters warned. 139\n"

      "The death toll from a typhoon that struck China on the weekend has risen to 19, with four people missing, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday.  Seven people were killed in typhoon-triggered tornados in the southern province of Guangdong while seven died in landslides, Xinhua said citing the provincial civil affairs department.  Three fishermen died in boat accidents at sea while one person was found dead in the debris of a house that collapsed during the storm. Four fishermen were missing, Xinhua said.  The storm made landfall in Zhanjiang prefecture in the southwest of Guangdong province on Sunday, triggering widespread blackouts.  For most of its passage across the South China Sea after crossing the Philippines, Mujigae was a tropical storm then low-level typhoon. As it approached land, however, Mujigae intensified to a category 2 cyclone with sustained winds of 154-177 km/h on the international Saffir-Simpson wind scale, then jumped to Category 4 – with winds up to 298km/h capable of causing catastrophic damage – as it crossed land. The highest category on the scale is 5, or “super typhoon”.  Mujigae’s affects were felt over much of western and central Guangdong, hundreds of kilometres from the storm’s centre. Its outer rainbands spawned tornadoes that killed at least three people in Foshan, near Guangdong, while some of the heaviest rain fell in Hong Kong.  Winds knocked out power grids along the coast and authorities cancelled dozens of flights and suspended high-speed trains.  Guangdong’s civil affairs department estimates the province suffered 23 billion yuan (HK$28 billion) in losses from the storm, which affected 3.5 million people and damaged more than 280,000 hectares of crops.  One person was also killed by a falling tree in the neighbouring Guangxi province, Xinhua reported. Nearly 1.9 million people in Guangxi suffered losses and 417 homes were destroyed, it said. 140\n",
      "HANGZHOU, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from an east China landslide has risen to 21, with 16 people still missing, local authorities said Sunday.  Only one person has been rescued so far after the landslide hit a village in Zhejiang Province Friday night.  The landslide was reported at around 10:50 p.m. in Lidong Village of Yaxi Township in the outlying Liandu District of Lishui City, the city government said in a press release.  Torrents of mud and rocks buried 27 homes in the village, with 21 houses flooded.  Mao Zirong, Lishui's standing deputy mayor, said the large amount of mud has formed a small barrier lake at the site, hampering rescue efforts.  The local government has dispatched 52 teams composed of more than 620 people to investigate the site in case of any further disasters.  \"We have sent a team of 35 professional psychologists to provide psychological intervention for the family members of the victims,\" said Yang Xiuqing, head of Liandu District.  More than 2,300 rescuers, along with 7 sniffer dogs, are helping with rescue work.  Lishui has reported heavy rain over the past two days. As of 8 a.m. Friday, average precipitation had reached 36 mm. It was still raining when the landslide happened, the local weather bureau said. 141\n",

      "Message sent on behalf of Mr. Ignacio Leon-Garcia Head of OCHA Regional Office for Southern Africa  In Madagascar, Hellen continues to weakening, with maximum wind speeds of 55 km/h. At 09H00 local time (UTC+3) the weather system was located 250 km north-east of Morondava and is currently moving in a south-easterly direction into the Mozambique Channel. The National Bureau of Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC) have lifted all alerts. See attached map.  A multi-sector aerial assessment of the inaccessible districts of Soalalala, Mitsinjo and Besalampy identified damaged classrooms and flooded agricultural fields. There are reportedly needs in the sector of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), but most healthcare centres appear intact. The Prime Minister visited Soalala today, bringing relief items including water treatment products, medicines and cash.  Initial results indicate that 919 people have been displaced, of which some will be able to return home in the coming days. Over 170 houses were destroyed. Although local authorities have been quick to respond, it is expected that displaced families will need relief supplies (food, health and non-food item kits) to get through the coming weeks. WFP is dispatching one ton of high energy biscuits and 35 tons of foodstuffs to the operational base in Mahajanga where a 500 ton-capacity warehouse is open to all humanitarian partners.  Agriculture is particularly affected by the floods in an area that was already struggling with a locust outbreak in the last months. Over 3,900 ha of rice fields have been submerged. In the medium term, there are concerns over the food security situation. An in-depth assessment by food partners is being planned.  The child protection network in Mahajanga deployed social workers to monitor temporary sites. So far no cases violence or exploitation have been reported and no children were separated from their parents. Information on the districts of Soalala, Mitsinjo and Besalampy is currently being compiled following the aerial assessment. The Malagasy Red-Cross is also assessing the situation and is supporting displaced families and WASH activities. Additional pre-positioned Red Cross relief goods can be used in case needed following ongoing assessments.  As a result of funding constraints, a US$70,000 Emergency Cash Grant application has been submitted to OCHA, for logistical support to enable aerial assessments and provision of urgent relief items.  In Comoros, ongoing assessments by the General Directorate of Civil Protection (DGSC) and the Red Crescent have to date found that around 8,800 people have been affected by Tropical Cyclone Hellen.  In Anjouan, the poorest island in Comoros and the hardest hit, 7,869 people have been displaced, of which 6,142 are being hosted by relatives and 1,727 moved to 3 camps established at schools. An estimated 720 houses have been damaged and 180 houses destroyed. In Moheli, one death has been reported and 1,087 displaced people are being hosted by relatives. Three villages were flooded by storm surges and three others isolated by landslide. Electricity in some areas has still not been restored. In Grande Comores, roads have been damaged and houses flooded by a high tide. See attached map indicating impacts.  The situation is at this stage within the capacity of Government to respond. It is planning to dispatch over the next few days sufficient shelter and food supplies for those affected in Anjouan. Authorities have also started repairing roads. Other relief supplies are expected to be dispatched soon, with the assistance of UNICEF, which has also deployed a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) specialist to assist the Red Crescent in the management of the camps in Anjouan.  In Mozambique, according to the UN Resident Coordinator's Office, the heavy rains brought on by the system that eventually became Tropical Cyclone Hellen late last week affected an estimated 1,929 households (9,645 people) in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. The affected districts are Quissanga, Balama, Montepuez, Metuge, Ibo, Mecufi, Mocimba de Praia, Nangada and Muidumbe; seven of which are inaccessible by road from Pemba (the provincial capital, which is also affected). Any humanitarian support will therefore have to be by sea or air.  Most affected households are staying with host families. Some accommodation centers have been opened in Pemba for extremely vulnerable families. The Government would prefer affected families to remain with host families as much as possible. The National Institute of Disaster Management (INGC) is requesting the following humanitarian support via existing Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) structures:  400 tents for immediate shelter for families whose houses were completely destroyed;  100 tons of food to cover the food needs of those affected for a period of 1 month, including host families;  INGC is working to establish relocation communities to encourage people to leave the flood plains, for which it is requesting 600 shelter kits for families to start construction once an area has been identified in next couple days.  INGC will send a Mozambique Air Force plane to Pemba tomorrow to take three tons of food to cover immediate needs. WFP will mobilize trucks from Beira on 02 April with 160 tons of food and shelter kits from the NGO consortium COSACA. A full assessment will be carried out in the upcoming days, which will be joined by HCT partners. Authorities will be preparing damaged roads and bridges. The situation is under control and a plan is underway to support affected families.  The CCGC (Coordinating Council for Disaster Management) will meet tomorrow to make further decisions on the current situation and response in Cabo Delgado. The meeting will also consider the possibility of the Ex-Hellen weather system making landfall over Mozambique on 05 April, potentially affecting the provinces of Sofala and Nampula. 148\n",

      "IDMC bases its estimates on the Republic of Congo’s own government estimate, which was published in its Displaced Populations Report of March 2009. This is the latest source available  Up to 800,000 people in the Republic of the Congo – a quarter of the country’s population – were internally displaced during the 1990s by armed conflict in the Pool region between government forces and rebels originating from among the Lari ethnic group. The conflict ended in 2003, and by 2006, according to a government estimate, only 7,800 people remained displaced in Pool.  The figure’s most important limitation is that no new assessment of the number of IDPs has been conducted since 2009. Therefore, it is not known if IDPs have achieved durable solutions, leaving unanswered the question of whether internal displacement has really ended in the Republic of Congo.  The above figures do not include people displaced by slow-onset and sudden-onset natural hazards. In November 2012, for example, floods displaced an unknown number of people in Pointe-Noire, along Congo’s coast, and it is not known how many of those displaced have been able to return to their homes  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it. 150\n",

      "Costa Rica saw further heavy rainfall and flooding on Monday 06 July and Tuesday 07 July 2015. WMO report that Puerto Limon saw 174.9 mm of rain fall in 24 hours during that period. Costa Rica’s National Meteorological Institute have warned that the heavy rainfall will continue.  Costa Rica’s National Emergency Commission (Comisión Nacional de Prevención de Riesgos y Atención de Emergencias – CNE) issued a red alert for parts of Heredia and Limón provinces.  Authorities say that the rain and flooding has forced a total of 1057 people to evacuate thier homes and move to one of the 13 temporary shelters set up by CNE, many of them in local community halls or churches. Most of those displaced are in the canton of Sarapiqui.  As of 07 July 2015, 94 communities across 15 cantons were facing access problems after roads had been flooded or damaged.  2 Weeks of Flooding  This latest period of heavy rain means that parts of Costa Rica have suffered flooding for over 2 weeks. Floods in the Caribbean and Northern regions on 21 June 2015 left 25 communities isolated and hundreds displaced.  After a short respite, where some of those affected were able to return to thier homes, northern and eastern parts of the country were faced with further torrential rain on 27 June which caused damage to roads, bridges and houses, and affected over 200 communities across 3 provinces of Limón, Heredia and Cartago.  Colombia and Venezuela  The heavy rain is continuing to fall in parts of northern Colombia and Venzuela, both of which have been hit by floods over the last 10 days. Over 50 mm of rain fell in 24 hours between 06 and 07 July in Arauca, Colombia, according to WMO. Guanare in Venezuela saw 53 mm of rain in the same period.

      "  Current situation  Heavy rainfall in Eastern Croatia from 13-15 May 2014, has caused large-scale flooding with subsequent collapse of transit routes and evacuation of local population. In three days the precipitation levels have exceeded the average for three months. The floods forced the evacuation of, according to the latest data, 17,631 people. They are currently located in 6 collective centres in the adjacent region, as well as in many private homes of people who took them in. Further 36,000 people in Croatia are currently endangered by the floods. Over 17,000 school children are currently unable to attend school. There have been 2 casualties so far.  Until now, 4,367 housing units have been flooded and we anticipate that around 30% of them will need to be demolished because they will most likely have to be deemed unsuitable for habitation. Around 50% of all crops have been destroyed, and around 21,000 cattle have been evacuated from the flooded area. The most effected cities and municipalities are: Slavonski Brod, Municipality of Oriovac, Municipality of Slavonski Šamac, Municipality of Oprisavci, Municipality of Okučani and the wider area of Županja.  In the whole affected region (Croatia, B-H and Serbia), more than 100,000 homes, 230 schools, businesses, roads and railways were washed out by the flooding.  Croatia has been able to address the immediate humanitarian relief needs in the flooded areas on its territory with its own capacities. However, in order to address the needs of the affected people and areas in the short-, medium- and long term, on 23 May 2014 the Government of Croatia has sent an appeal for international humanitarian assistance.  Response  Over 4000 officials and even a larger number of volunteers have been activated directly in activities related to rescue and protection. Furthermore, the Croatian Government has approved a programme of communal public works in order to contribute to the rehabilitation from the consequences of flooding. A minimal wage shall be paid to the people currently unemployed to join the programme.  All relevant line ministries have introduced measures for immediate relief, e.g. shelter, food and care for the displaced, books for the children, chemical (disinfection) and physical (removal of carcasses) decontamination of the area, feed for the evacuated cattle etc. In a coordinated effort, the Ministry of Social Policy and Youth, with the Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Defence collected humanitarian aid from citizens and have sent in-kind assistance as well as monetary and psychosocial assistance to evacuated families.  Rapidly changing circumstances in the field, vastness of the flooded area, damage on the houses, other facilities, crops and cattle, threat of dislocated landmines and a large number of long-term displaced persons from Croatia, as well as from Bosnia and Hercegovina, along with continually arriving offers of assistance from our friends in the international community, prompted Croatia to issue a humanitarian appeal and ask for international assistance.  On 23 May 2014 Croatia has issued an international humanitarian appeal in order to effectively meet the needs of the affected population and regions. The international community has been informed about the concrete needs, most of which can in best way be covered by direct financial assistance. In general, we have been able to address the immediate humanitarian relief needs in Croatia for food, shelter and medical care, as well as provide assistance to the neighbouring countries. However, we anticipate that in the medium- and long-term there will be a gap between the immediate relief and subsequent rehabilitation, reconstruction and development.  Currently, the water level has started to recede. All available forces for protection and rescue activities continue to work on strengthening the existing and in building new dikes, sharing food and water for vulnerable populations, rescuing survivors and disposing of animal carcasses. The situation remains complex due to landslides and road damages. State and local authorities are engaged in on-going evacuation efforts.  Thorough analysis of the current situation in affected areas has already begun as well as a breakdown of necessary activities and tasks for the forthcoming period. Even though water levels have begun to recede there is a fear for new disasters since the area is contaminated with landmines and other non-exploded remnants of war. Due to the flooding the landmines may have been dislocated outside the previously marked locations, which make the subsequent assessment of the damage, clearing and the reconstruction of the flooded areas even more delicate and dangerous. The cleaning of landmines in two municipalities of Gunja and Vrbanja is estimated at the cost of 4 million euros. In order to find a regional solution for this sensitive issue Croatia is communicating with experts from Bosnia and Hercegovina and Serbia.  Furthermore, we are facing the rising threat of mosquitos in the flooded areas in all three countries. This problem will be resolved regionally with the assistance of the EU. Overall sanitary decontamination of the area is also a precondition for further steps. Another pressing issue is to provide longer-term shelter in form of air-conditioned containers for the displaced people until their homes will be dried and reconstructed.  CONCRETE NEEDS  Bearing in mind a constant change of circumstances affecting the needs-assessment, the possibility of more effective utilisation of capacities otherwise needed for coordination, transport, storage and dissemination of in-kind assistance, and the potential mobilisation of our own resources (e.g. in the field of demining), in order to adequately, effectively and sustainably respond to the catastrophe, financial assistance would be the preferred alternative of support, without prejudice to other kinds of assistance offered.  Croatian assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia  Croatia extended aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia comprising of financial means, goods and manpower. The Croatian Government has provided financial assistance in the amount of 200,000 euros, to the Bosnian and Serbian Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. We are accommodating displaced people from Bosnia and Hercegovina (currently about 500) which are crossing the border and looking for refuge in Eastern Croatia.  To Bosnia and Hercegovina we sent 2 helicopters, 9 motor boats, 15 vehicles, civil protection team, fire-fighters, divers and policemen totalling 52 people. They have evacuated and saved more than 1,000 people. 90,000 sand bags have been delivered.  To the most endangered municipalities in Serbia, we sent 4 divers and 2 policemen. After having finished the operations in Eastern Croatia, we pledged to send 2 motorboats, 5 vehicles, one civil protection unit and one firefighting team, in total 15 personnel. A water purification system has been offered.  Financial donations to citizens of the flood-hit areas of Croatia can be made in two different ways:  http://www.mvep.hr/en/info-servis/press-releases/,21638.html 154\n"

      "Some 50 people were forced to leave their homes due to a strong fire that has broken out around 11:00 pm on Monday night on the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac, the country's national TV station reported.  Around 2 kilometers of pine woods are burning and the flames have reached the houses of the town of Trstenik around 3:00 am on Tuesday morning despite the efforts taken by the fire brigades. Almost all the residents of the entire town were evacuated, the news portal Index.hr reads.  The situation is dire as well in the region of Smokvica and the Korcula Peninsula, where a fire has erupted over the weekend. After it was localized on the peninsula's northeastern side, the flames went out of control again on Monday. However, the situation is most critical in the region of Brno where so far the fire has burnt around 500 hectares of pine woods.  Besides the fire brigades, special planes are also deployed to extinguish the fire. 155\n",
      "Vodeni val je prošao Karlovac, vodostaji rijeka Kupe i Korane napokon su se spustili ispod osam metara, što je za više od pola metra niže no što su bili jučer kada je vladao potpuni kaos.  \"On je već deset godina gradonačelnik i s gradskim je čelništvom već mogao djelatno pokazati volju da se rješava problem poplava, a ne samo da čeka pomoć države. Grad je već mogao obaviti nužne pripreme, izdati suglasnosti, dozvole i druge dokumente za projekt vodozaštite\", izjavio je ministar Jakovina..  \"Ispričavam se svim stradalima zbog poplava na karlovačkom području zbog krivih prognoza. Svi su podaci upućivali na niži vodostaj, ali i to nam ukazuje na neumoljivost i nepredvidivost prirode. Na nebranjenim su području pričinjene velike štete i zbog toga mi je veoma žao. I ovaj nam slučaj govori da moramo intenzivno nastaviti sustavnu obranu od poplava u koju smo uložili 350 milijuna kuna. Za taj smo projekt planirali i novac iz kohezijskog fonda EU. U narednih sedam godina za te potrebe očekujemo pomoć od 250 milijuna eura\", rekao je Jakovina.  Kupa je na sisačkom području u stalnoim laganom porastu, najviši i rekordni vodeni val, koji dolazi iz Karlovca, očekuje se u nedjelju, a već je pod vodom stotinjak vikendica na području Letovanića. U Farkašiću je oko podneva vodostaj iznosio 960 centimetara, pa je na tom području proglašeno izvanredno stanje obrane od poplava. Stručnjaci predviđaju da bi za 24 sata vodostaj mogao narasti i do rekordnih tisuću centimetara. Vatrogasci i mještani pokupskih naselja nastavljaju podizanje zečjih nasipa na najugroženijim područjima.  \"Iako očekujemo kako će štete biti minorne, sa strepnjom očekujemo vodni val koji bi do sisačkog područja trebao stići noćas ili sutra ujutro, pa su sve službe u punoj pripravnosti\", rekao je ministar Jakovina.  U Karlovcu pod vodom 343 kuće, mještani bijesni na ministra Jakovinu  u Karlovcu je zbog poplava u petak proglašena elementarna nepogoda, a zatvorene za promet su dvije državne ceste, sedam županijskih i sedam lokalnih.  Nešto iza podneva u subotu, iz Karlovca se javio naš reporter Ivan Vrdoljak.  Ono najgore u Karlovcu je prošlo, situacija se smirila no vodostaji su i dalje vrlo visoki. U odnosu na jučerašnje maksimalne vodostaje Kupe od 855 centimetara, sada je taj vodostaj pao za gotovo pola metra. On sada iznosi od 807 do 809 centimetara za obje rijeke, Kupu i Koranu.  Prema posljednjim informacijama Državne uprave za zaštitu i spašavanje, u Karlovcu su 343 kuće pod vodom.  Sve su državne ceste na karlovačkom području zatvorene i njima se može putovati isključivo čamcima. Pohvalna je reakcija vatrogasaca, volontera i ronioca koji ovdje dežuraju 27 do 30 sati i pomažu ljudima.  Opasnost se sada iz Karlovca u kojem će se štete zbrajati tjednima seli nizvodno s Kupom. Lokalci su bijesni na vladajuće strukture, posebno na ministra poljoprivrede Tihomira Jakovinu, pošto je prije samo dva dana bio ovdje i tvrdio da je situacija pod kontrolom. 156\n",
      "Over 2,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes in Baracoa, in Guantánamo Province, Cuba, after a storm and severe flooding damaged 100s of homes in the areas, according to Cuba’s State News Agency, Granma.  This is the second major flood event to hit Cuba in the last few days. Wide areas of the capital city of Havana were flooded on 30 April after 188 mm of rain fell in 24 hours. At least 2 people died and several buildings collapsed. Havana has not been affected by the heavy rain this time around.  Granma say that 350.7 mm of rain fell in Baracoa from 02 to 03 May 2015.  The rain forced rivers to burst their banks and resulting floods damaged homes, roads and crops. The areas of La Granjita and Horno de Cal were said to be the worst hit. Over 250 homes were damaged either by flooding or strong winds. At least 4 homes were completely destroyed. Some of those displaced have since started to return to their homes  More Severe Weather Expected  El Instituto de Meteorología de Cuba (Insmet) yesterday forecast more severe weather, including heavy rain, over the next few days.  Over the last 24 hours, Puerto Padre, Las Tunas, also on Cuba’s northern coast, saw 85 mm of rain. On the south coast, Santa Cruz Del Sur, Camaguey, saw 53.8 mm of rain. 157\n",

      "The figure is the number of people registered as IDPs by the government of the Republic of Cyprus (GoC, 2014) and includes around 117,000 people with IDP registration who were displaced in 1974 and who are still alive.  The government of Cyprus continues to register IDPs on the basis of identity cards given to people who, at the time of the Turkish invasion:  lived in the northern part of the island, that later declared itself as the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (TRNC);  had a permanent residence in areas under the control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus because of their profession but their house and/or their property was in areas controlled by TRNC;  temporarily lived abroad due to professional obligations that arose while they resided in Cyprus.  Moreover, descendants of people with the identity card are also eligible to receive such identity cards and to be recognised as IDPs (GoC).  Displacement occurred in 1974 as groups backed by Greece’s military junta ousted the Cypriot leader, and Turkey sent troops to the island in response. As a result, Greek Cypriots fled to the south, while Turkish Cypriots fled to the north. In both cases, thousands of people were forced from their homes, suffered significant loss and needed large-scale assistance.  Turkish Cypriots live in the TRNC, only recognized by Turkey. In 1975, following the Vienna III Agreement, the TRNC declared that the internal displacement situation was over, and the residents were given the option to move with[IS1] in TRNC with assistance, or to remain where they were with protection guarantees. Since that time the “TRNC” has not granted displaced status or benefits to people displaced to TRNC (IDMC, 20 June 2009).  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it. 159\n",

      "Las fuertes lluvias registradas durante el fin de semana, producto de un “disturbio tropical”, incomunicaron 23 comunidades, afectaron 606 viviendas y dejaron al menos una persona ahogada y otra desaparecida.    El director del Centro de Operaciones de Emergencias (COE), general Juan Manuel Méndez, precisó que dos puentes y un sistema eléctrico fueron afectados, así como un hospital en San Pedro de Macorís, el cual resultó anegado.    Méndez subrayó que las personas desplazadas a casas de familiares y amigos ya comenzaron a retornar a sus hogares por lo que el número bajó de 4,015 a 3,603.    Asimismo, el organismo mantiene el alerta para 18 provincias, ante posibles inundaciones y deslizamiento de tierra.    La normalidad comenzó a retornar en las provincias de Hato Mayor y San Pedro de Macorís, las cuales se encontraban en alerta roja por el paso de la depresión tropical.    En Hato Mayor las aguas provocaron daños materiales e inundaciones. Mientras que en San Pedro de Macorís, los sectores más afectados fueron Puerto Rico y Planta Bella, donde se estima que residen unas dos mil personas.    Las aguas provocaron el derrumbe del puente que comunica a esos sectores, mientras que sus habitantes sacaban agua de sus casas, fruto de las lluvias registrada en horas de la madrugada del pasado sábado.    Los moradores de esos barrios llamaron a las autoridades a construir un muro de contención para evitar que en tiempo de lluvias sus casas se vean afectadas nuevamente por la crecida del río Paña Paña.    “Estamos cansados de esta situación. Mira nosotros pasamos la noche sacando agua de nuestras casas; tuvimos que subir los muebles y las neveras sobre madera para que no se nos dañaran, porque el agua entró a nuestras casas”, explicó el presidente de la Junta de Vecino de Planta Bella, Juan Francisco Pacheco. Las lluvias también derribaron parte de la verja perimetral de la escuela básica Los Hatillos, obra que fue inaugurada hace 10 días.    Silvana Javier, una anciana de 70 años, dijo que a pesar de perder parte de sus ajuares que adornaban su humilde vivienda, da gracias a Dios por estar viva, ya que fue auxiliada por una buena samaritana vecina suya, que solo identificó como Fior.    El jefe de la Defensa Civil de San Pedro de Macorís, Pablo Polanco Rojas, informó que por las inundaciones, más 350 personas fueron llevadas a casas de familiares y amigos, pero que la mayoría retornaron a sus casas.    Sin embargo, unas 40 personas, incluyendo 20 niños, aún están refugiadas en una iglesia cristiana del barrio Villa Progreso II, a quienes los Comedores Económicos les están suministrando los alimentos. Además de Villa Progreso, se vieron afectados los sectores: José Francisco Peña Gómez, Los Guandules, del 24 de Abril, Villa Municipal, Pedro Justo Carrión, Los Cangrejitos y otros.    En los sectores inundados, tanto en Hato Mayor como en San Pedro de Macorís, se observó una gran cantidad de agua en las diferentes calles y callejones.    Los afectados dijeron que recibieron raciones de alimentos, colchones y mosquiteros de manos de las autoridades municipales.    Anciano murió ahogado  Un hombre identificado como Chichí Reyes, de aproximadamente 70 años, murió ahogado por el desbordamiento del arroyo Paña-Paña, en el sector Villa Ortega de Hato Mayor.    El reporte detalla que la víctima fue arrastrada por las aguas cuando intentó salir de su hogar.    El director del COE recordó que la provincia Hato Mayor está en alerta desde hace tres días y que esta situación conlleva la obligación, no solo de las autoridades, sino también de la población.    “Siempre señalamos que deben abstenerse de cruzar arroyos, ríos y cañadas que presenten grandes volúmenes de agua”, refirió  Un desaparecido  Los organismos de socorro buscaban ayer al empresario Alfonso Astacio (Manito Fonso), nativo de Hato Mayor, quien fue arrastrado por las aguas cuando, abordo de su camioneta, intentó cruzar el Río Naranjo.    El director del COE, afirmó que en ese caso no podían atribuírsela a las fuertes precipitaciones porque se debía a una “inobservancia” de la víctima al tratar de cruzar un río pese a la alerta emitida por las autoridades.    “En este caso intentaron cruzar un río en Hato Mayor en una camioneta y por eso resultó esa persona afectada. Nos unimos al dolor que embarga a esa familia, pero no va a entrar dentro de este operativo porque básicamente fue algo que fue una inobservancia de lo que establecen la ley y los reglamentos” explicó.  Se alejó del país    El disturbio tropical se alejó del país y fue localizado próximo a las Bahamas, donde se convirtió en la tormenta tropical Cristóbal, con movimiento hacia el noreste.    La Oficina Nacional de Meteorología, mantiene el aviso meteorológico contra inundaciones y deslizamientos de tierra a los residentes en zonas bajas cercanas a ríos, arroyos y cañadas en las provincias San Pedro de Macorís, La Romana,    La Altagracia, El Seibo, Hato Mayor, María Trinidad Sánchez, Santiago, Duarte, San José de Ocoa y Azua. Además, continúa con el Alerta meteorológica contra inundaciones urbanas para el gran Santo Domingo, San Pedro de Macorís y Santiago. Por otro lado, se recomienda a los operadores de las frágiles y pequeñas embarcaciones permanecer en puerto en todo el perímetro costero, debido a olas y viento anormales. l    Las lluvias mejorarán servicio de agua potable      El director de la Corporación del Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Santo Domingo dijo que las lluvias caídas este fin de semana han mejorado notablemente el servicio de agua potable en todo el Gran Santo Domingo.    Alejandro Montás señaló que el servicio será mucho mejor a partir de mañana martes ya que la producción de agua potable se colocaría en los niveles esperados para producir más de 360 millones de galones diarios para distribuirlos en el Distrito Nacional y la provincia Santo Domingo.    El funcionario dijo que las lluvias han mejorado los sistemas Valdesia, Haina-Manoguayabo, Isa-Mana, Duey, Isabela y Barrera de Salinidad.    Montás precisó que la Presa Jigüey se encontraba en la cota 504.44 y la de Valdesia en 135.65, lo que significa que en las últimas 24 horas Jigüey ha incrementado su nivel en 86 centímetros y Valdesia en 63 centímetros.      Disminuirán lluvias  Para este lunes se prevé una disminución gradual de las precipitaciones a medida que se aleje la nubosidad asociada a la tormenta tropical”.    MOPC evalúa daños provocaron lluvias      El Ministerio de Obras Públicas y Comunicaciones (MOPC) informó ayer que evalúa los daños en estructuras viales en la región Este, provocados por los fuertes aguaceros registrados en los últimos tres días a consecuencia del disturbio tropical que afectó a Puerto Rico y el país.    Funcionarios del MOPC, el director del COE, y el director de la Comisión Militar y Policial de Obras Públicas, general Estanislao Gonell Regalado, en compañía de autoridades provinciales y municipales, supervisaron la región Este para percatarse de los daños causados por el fenómeno atmosférico, evaluarlos y luego proceder a repararlos.    Ramón Pepín, director general asistente del MOPC, dijo que el ministro Gonzalo Castillo, por instrucciones del presidente Danilo Medina, envió la comisión de funcionarios a las provincias San Pero de Macorís, Hato Mayor y El Seibo, con fines de que inspeccionen las vías y se proceda a reparar los daños ocasionados por las lluvias a la mayor brevedad posible.  Pepín indicó que en Hato Mayor hay dos puntos críticos, uno en el puente ubicado en la calle 30 de Marzo, cuyo asfalto fue levantado por la crecida de una cañada, y otro puente que su área hidráulica fue entaponada, lo que provocó el desbordamiento de otra cañada. Asimismo, los aproches del puente-badén de la comunidad de Yerba Buena fueron erosionados por la crecida del río, mientras que en El Seibo se evaluó el puente-badén de la comunidad La Cuchilla, también afectado por la crecida del río. 165\n",
      "Torrential rain since Saturday 01 November 2014 led to flooding in Cibao region, northern Dominican Republic. Nearly 60 mm of rain fell in Puerto Plata during 24 hours from 02 to 03 November 2014, according to WMO. Further flooding is possible and flood warnings have been issued for Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.  According to local emergency authorities, at least one person has been killed in the flooding, and around 100 homes inundated. The victim died after he was swept away by a swollen river in Santiago Rodriguez province.  In Dajabón province, the Dajabón River (also called Massacre River) has burst its banks, forcing over 100 families to evacuate after their homes were inundated. Flooding also caused damage to crops and livestock.  Haiti  The Dajabón River marks the border between the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It is likely that flooding has also affected communities on the Haitian side of the river, although there are as yet no reports to confirm this.  Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands  Neighbouring islands including Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, have been warned of possible flash floods over the next 24 hours. According to NOAA (the US Weather Agency) a weather system will mean slow moving thunderstorms in the area, capable of producing torrential rains in a short period. In addition, recent heavy rains over the past few days has resulted in saturated soils and above average streamflows. Runoff from any additional rain will result in flooding as rivers will react quickly. 166\n"

      "Heavy rain and floods have prompted emergency authorities in the Dominican Republic to evacuated over 15,000 people, mostly in the country’s north and eastern regions.  Over 70 mm of rain fell in 24 hours between 20 and 21 February in Savana de la Mar, a town in the Hato Mayor province of the Dominican Republic. Puerto Plata in the northern province Puerto Plata, saw 53.7 mm during the same period. The following day the Las Americas airport area close to Santo Domnigo saw 58.9mm of rain.  The worst affected districts are Puerto Plata, Espaillat and María Trinidad Sánchez, which as of yesterday were under red flood alert, while Santiago, Duarte, Sanchez Ramirez and Hermanas Mirabal were on yellow flood alert.  The heavy rain caused rivers to overflow. Damage has been reported to crops and roads, as well as 1 bridge.  Emergency Operations Center (COE) said that 3,979 homes have been flooded or damaged and 20 completely destroyed. As of 23 February 2015, no injuries or fatalities have been reported.  At one point more than 20,000 people displaced. According to the latest Emergency Operations Center (COE) report of 22 February at 08:00 local time, that figure has since fallen to 15,475.  The disaster management agency also said around 30 locations or communities have been cut off by the flooding.  One person died in flooding in the Dominican republic in November 2014. Neighbouring Haiti was also badly hit by flooding during that time. As many as 8 people died in the November 2014 floods in Haiti. The country was also hit by further flooding earlier this month (February 2015).  No flooding has been reported in Haiti recently, although information regarding flooding there is often difficult to find. 167\n",
      "Imagen de la trayectoria que podría tomar en las próximas horas la tormenta tropical Erika, según el Centro Nacional de Huracanes de Estados Unidos. (NOAA NWS National Hurricane Center / FACEBOOK)  Imagen de la trayectoria que podría tomar en las próximas horas la tormenta tropical Erika, según el Centro Nacional de Huracanes de Estados Unidos. (NOAA NWS National Hurricane Center / FACEBOOK)  Las lluvias y fuertes vientos de la tormenta Erika provocaron el viernes inundaciones en República Dominicana, donde más de 7,300 personas fueron evacuadas luego de que el fenómeno dejara una estela de destrucción y 20 muertos en la isla de Dominica.  Sólo vimos cómo volaban Juan Manuel Méndez, director del centro de operaciones de emergencias de República Dominicana, detalló en conferencia de prensa que 823 viviendas fueron afectadas por las inundaciones en diferentes partes del país y tres quedaron completamente destruidas.  \"Sólo vimos cómo volaban\" los techos de zinc de las casas, dijo Altagracia Santana, de 27 años y madre de tres hijos, por vía telefónica a The Associated Press. Santana reside en un barrio marginal de la provincia San Cristóbal, 30 kilómetros al oeste de la capital.  Méndez indicó que, debido a las inundaciones, tres pequeñas localidades rurales de San Cristóbal estaban incomunicadas.  El centro de la tormenta ingresó la tarde del viernes a través de la provincia Barahona a la isla La Hispaniola, que comparten Haití y República Dominicana.  La mayoría de los más de 7,350 evacuados fueron ubicados en casas de familiares y amigos en zonas de menor riesgo. Méndez destacó que todo el país permanece en alerta máxima, ya que las lluvias continuarán durante el sábado.  \"El mayor peligro es la gran cantidad de lluvias\", consideró Gloria Ceballos, directora de la oficina dominicana de meteorología. Detalló que, aunque existe posibilidad de que la tormenta se degrade el sábado a depresión tropical, el campo nuboso que cubre gran parte de la isla provocará que los aguaceros se prolonguen durante el sábado y dejen lluvias acumuladas de entre cinco y 20 centímetros.  En alerta  Los organismos de socorro de República Dominicana mantenían la alerta en todo el país ante posibles inundaciones, mientras que las clases escolares fueron suspendidas y el gobierno ordenó cerrar las actividades laborales al mediodía para que la población permaneciera en su casas durante el paso del fenómeno.  Las autoridades de Haití declararon una alerta preventiva ante las inminentes lluvias La tormenta se ha desplazado durante todo el viernes al sur de la costa meridional dominicana, provocando precipitaciones y fuertes vientos en las localidades costeras, incluida la capital, donde algunos árboles, postes de energía eléctrica y anuncios publicitarios se derrumbaron sobre las avenidas sin provocar daños significativos.  A las 8 de la noche, el centro del fenómeno atmosférico se ubicaba a 45 kilómetros al sureste de la capital haitiana y avanzaba a 33 kilómetros por hora hacia el oeste.  Las autoridades de Haití declararon una alerta preventiva ante las inminentes lluvias y posibles inundaciones.  Las lluvias \"serán un paliativo de la sequía que ha afectado al país, pero no va a ser una solución definitiva\", consideró Ceballos, de la oficina de meteorología dominicana, al recordar que el fenómeno El Niño ha provocado la sequía más severa que vive la isla en los últimas dos décadas.  Las aerolíneas Cubana de Aviación y Spirit cancelaron los vuelos que tenían previstos para el viernes desde el aeropuerto de Santo Domingo.  Rescatistas de la isla de Dominica, en el este del Caribe, continuaban el viernes la búsqueda de personas heridas y de desaparecidos durante el paso de la tormenta el jueves, que dejó al menos 20 muertos, lluvias de hasta 38 centímetros, desbordamiento de ríos, deslizamientos de tierra y el colapso de algunos puentes.  \"Me preparaba para ir a trabajar cuando de pronto escuché un fuerte ruido y vi el lugar lleno de agua\", djio Shanie James, una madre de 30 años y empleada de una panadería. \"Tuvimos que correr para sobrevivir\".  La cuenta de muertos se incrementará  Los deslizamientos de tierra destruyeron decenas de viviendas en Dominica, como la casa de Peter Julian, un agente de seguridad de 46 años.  Tomará un par de días recuperar los cuerpos \"Cuando regresé, vi que mi casa donde he vivido por 20 años había desaparecido\", afirmó.  Roosevelt Skerrit, primer ministro de Dominica, dijo el viernes que hay 20 muertos y que la isla sufrió un retroceso de 20 años debido a los destrozos provocados por la tormenta. También exhortó a la población a que ayude a limpiar las calles donde cayeron árboles y lodo.  Un hombre y dos niños murieron cuando el lodo penetró en su vivienda en el sureste de Dominica, mientras que el cuerpo de otro hombre fue hallado en su casa afectada por un deslizamiento de tierra, dijo el jefe de la policía Daniel Carbon.  La cuenta total de víctimas mortales en Dominica se incrementará, insistió Carbon, pero advirtió que \"tomará un par de días recuperar los cuerpos\".  Claude Weekes, asistente del superintendente de la policía, indicó que las autoridades aún no han podido llegar a las zonas montañosas debido a los daños en vías y puentes. \"Ha sido realmente devastador\", consideró el oficial.  En Puerto Rico, las lluvias afectaron principalmente el sur de la isla y provocaron apagones que afectaron a unas 200,000 personas. 168\n",

      "Plus de 2 000 personnes sont victimes des inondations à la suite des pluies qui se sont abattues, depuis deux jours, dans cinq localités du groupement Mupfunyi-Shanga, en territoire de Masisi (Nord-Kivu). Il s’agit notamment des localités de Rueni, Maona, Nyamubingwa et Kyabondo, situées au bord du lac Kivu.  Le chef de ce groupement, François Muharuro Wetemwami, a livré cette information, mercredi dans la matinée, après une ronde dans toutes ces localités touchées par les eaux de pluie.  Il a indiqué que les élèves ne vont plus à l’école et toutes les activités commerciales et champêtres sont paralysées, après la destruction de plus de 25 hectares de champs.  François Muharuro Wetemwami parle de plus de 400 maisons emportées par les eaux de pluies dans ces cinq villages ainsi que de la destruction de plus de 20 bornes fontaines.  Le chef du groupement Mupfunyi-Shanga indique également que des sinistrés sont, depuis quelques jours, sans nourriture.  Selon Patient Mayele Nyamwaka, représentant des enseignants de ce groupement, quatre écoles (deux primaires et deux secondaires) sont complètement détruites par ces eaux des pluies. Les élèves sont ainsi contraints de rester à la maison.  Ils passent leurs journées dans la boue dans l’espoir de récupérer quelques habits dans ce qui reste de leurs maisons détruites par les eaux de pluie. Leurs parents clament déjà leur incapacité à réhabiliter ces maisons.  Une autre pluie du samedi 4 octobre avait provoqué la mort de trois personnes. Huit personnes avait été blessées grièvement dans le groupement voisin de Bweremana, en territoire de Masisi, à 50 km à l’Ouest de Goma (Nord-Kivu). 172\n",
      "Trois cent quarante maisons se sont écroulées suite aux inondations survenues en deux semaines dans la cité de Tshela dans le Bas-Congo. L’administrateur du territoire, Charles Ilowa Nkoyi, qui a livré ce bilan dimanche 27 avril à Radio Okapi, a indiqué que les sinistrés ont reçu du gouvernement un terrain et huit milles tôlent pour se construire de nouvelles habitations.  « On n’a pas attendu longtemps lancer un cri de détresse. Le gouvernement tant national que provincial est venu en aide aux sinistrés. Le gouverneur Jacques Mbadu a apporté des vivres, et d’autres biens en nature pour aider les personnes qui avaient perdu leurs maisons. Le gouvernement central nous a amené les matériaux de construction », a affirmé Charles Ilowa Nkoyi.  Il a assuré que les travaux de construction des maisons pour ces sinistrés vont bientôt commencer.  Plusieurs maisons d’habitations et des ponts ont été endommagés lors des dernières pluies qui se sont abattues, mercredi 16 avril dernier, à Tshela, cité située à plus de 200 km de la ville de Matadi (Bas-Congo). 173\n",

Selon le chargé de communication de la société civile de Basoko, José Bosulu, il s’agit des villages Liambe, Ilongo Mbutu, Ilongo Koki, Yameele, Yangenda et Mokongo.  Les villages sont abandonnés par plusieurs centaines d’habitants. Ils vivent dans les familles d’accueil notamment à Basoko-centre. D’après la même source, d’autres habitants sont restés sur place. Ils se sont construit des huttes sur de petites collines. Les familles des pécheurs vivent dans les pirogues, a poursuivi José Bosulu.  Certaines victimes de cette situation disent avoir perdu leurs ustensiles de ménages.  Selon l’union des producteurs agricoles de Basoko, les victimes de ces inondations se plaignent aussi de la destruction de leurs champs et du manque d’eau potable.  Selon des sources médicales, les sources d’eau sont inondées. Cette situation concerne également une dizaine d’autres villages riverains non encore submergés.  Les comités de santé déplorent la dégradation des conditions hygiéniques. Ils font état de l’inondation des latrines et cimetières dans ces villages.

John Bompengo  Plus de deux cents maisons inondées, quelques unes effondrées et plusieurs poteaux électriques de la Société nationale de l’électricité (Snel) écroulés. Des dégâts enregistrés après la pluie diluvienne qui s’est abattue dimanche 22 mars sur la ville de Kindu pendant 4 heures. Pour le moment, aucune perte en vies humaines n’a été enregistrée.  La commune la plus touchée est celle d’Alunguli où plus de cent quatre-vingts maisons ont été détruites, selon l’ONG YMC. Beaucoup de familles ont passé la nuit dehors.  Les maisons effondrées étaient construites en matériaux semi-durables. Et les débris des murs écroulés ont rendu les avenues et les ruelles inaccessibles.  Les victimes lancent un SOS aux humanitaires ainsi qu’aux autorités provinciales que nationales pour une aide d’urgence.  Le maire de la ville et le ministre provincial des Infrastructures ont appelé plusieurs familles habitant le long des cours d’eau et des rivières de déménager le plutôt possible.

      "Dégâts de pluie à Kalemie, samedi 8/09/2012  Plus de 200 maisons se sont écroulées et plusieurs autres inondées à Kalemie (Katanga) après une pluie diluvienne, a indiqué dimanche 20 avril le commissaire de district du Tanganyika, Jean-Félix Ilunga Mpafu, donnant un bilan provisoire dressé lors d’une réunion qu’il a tenue avec les différents chefs de quartiers de la ville. Le quartier le plus touché est celui de Kamkolobondo, qui enregistre une centaine de maisons écroulées. Viennent ensuite les quartiers construits sur la baie du lac Tanganyika et le littoral de la rivière Lukuga. La Croix-Rouge locale redoute les épidémies.  La rivière Kalemie a débordé dimanche à la suite de la pluie diluvienne s’est abattue depuis 03 heures du matin, entrainant des inondations dans la partie sud-est de la ville de Kalemie. Le quartier Kamkolobondo et une partie des installations de la Société nationale des chemins de fer (SNCC) abritant différents bureaux de l’Etat et le service maritime sont touchés.  Ce quartier compte une centaine des maisons d’habitations inondées, dont une église de la 30e Communauté pentecôtiste du Congo (CPCO) écroulée. Le bilan provisoire avancé par des responsables locaux fait aussi état des dizaines d’autres infrastructures inondées au quartier Maluku non loin du Camp Police.  «Ici, c’est encore mieux! Mais, je vous dis qu’au Camp de la Gendarmerie, c’est plus grave qu’ici. Certaines maisons qui se sont écroulées et le pont même était [inondé]. Il y a un groupe de gens qui ont commencé à prier ; ils se sont enfermés dans l’église. Je ne sais pas leur sort actuellement», a témoigné un habitant du quartier Maluku.  L’écroulement des maisons, construites en majorité en briques adobes, pousse plusieurs habitants de Kamkolobondo à un déménagement forcé.  «Toutes les maisons sont en train de s’écrouler. Nous, nous quittons. Nous allons vivre chez l’oncle paternel», a affirmé Louise, 22 ans.  Du côté des autorités sanitaires et des humanitaires, cette situation n’augure pas de beaux jours sur la ville Le président de la Croix-Rouge, Kipoka Amani, a déclaré:  «C’est un quartier à épidémies très fortes. Il y a des fosses septiques qui sont enfouies dans l’eau et toutes ces matières fécales seront acheminées vers le lac. En tout cas, nous redoutons l’épidémie de cholera pour le moment.»  Suite à ce drame, Jean-Félix Ilunga Mpafu a appelé les habitants de Kalemie au respect des règles de construction:  «Je voudrais que notre population [et] nous tous agents de l’Etat nous puissions comprendre que nous avons l’obligation de développer notre ville de Kalemie. Pour construire, il ne faut pas qu’on commence à détruire ce qui est déjà construit.»  C’est pour la deuxième fois qu’une calamité de cette ampleur s’abat sur Kamkolobondo, En 1996, des pluies diluviennes similaires avaient fait des centaines d’autres sinistrés.

John Bompengo  Plus de soixante maisons en terre battue ont été détruites lundi dernier par des inondations causées par les eaux des rivières Tshikapa et Kasaï dans la ville de Tshikapa au Kasaï-Occidental. Selon le chef du bureau urbain des actions humanitaires et solidarité nationale, Raymond Masudi, qui a livré mardi 15 avril ce bilan provisoire, ces eaux ont dépassé leurs lits habituels jusqu’à plus de 100 mètres à certains endroits.  Depuis cette catastrophe, les habitants des quartiers touchés et une partie de la ville se ravitaillent en eau de pluie pour la consommation domestique.  Raymond Masudi a indiqué que les puits d’eau et quelques fontaines sont remplis de sable et de boue.  La majorité d’enfants de familles victimes de ces inondations ont des difficultés pour se rendre à l’école, a-t-il ajouté.  Il prévoit de transmettre un rapport circonstanciel à la hiérarchie provinciale et nationale pour une assistance ponctuelle.  Quelques chefs de quartiers rencontrés ont déploré un déplacement massif de la population afféctée par ce drame. Ces ménages sont obligés de vivre dans des familles d’accueil.  Par ailleurs, à Biponga et Mbodo, localités situées à 75 kilomètres au Nord-Ouest de Tshikapa, la population passe la nuit dans une église, étant donné que ces deux villages sont rasés par les eaux.  De son côté, le maire de Tshikapa invite la population à ne pas recourir à la pirogue pour la traversée, ni se baigner dans ces deux rivières en furie.

      "Floods in several areas of Democratic Republic of Congo, including the capital Kinshasa, have left at least 20 people dead since late November.  Kinshasa  BBC and Reuters are both reporting that severe flooding in the Democratic Republic of Congo capital has left dozens dead since late November.  Emmanuel Akweti, the local minister for the capital’s inner city, told the BBC that around 20 people have died since 29 November.  Reuters report that at least 31 people have died in Democratic Republic of Congo’s capital Kinshasa in the last three weeks in the worst flooding in years, the provincial interior minister said on Tuesday, warning conditions could get even worse.  Many of the deaths have occurred in communities living along or close the Congo River and its tributary, the Ndjili.  Local media, including Radio Okapi, have reported that the flooding worsened after a weekend of heavy rain which prompted rivers to overflow. Many have been forced from their homes. Those displaced are currently living along roadsides in the city, or have found refuge in churches, schools or other public buildings.  The floods have left many without drinking water after the Regideso water treatment plant was affected. Regideso said that the shortage of drinking water will affect 17 districts of eastern and central Kinshasa.  The rain is still falling and the flood situation could worsen. WMO report that 72 mm of rain was recorded in Kinshasa in a 24 hour period between 08 and 09 December 2015.  Équateur province  The station reports that thousands have been left homeless after the River Congo overflowed in parts of Équateur province. Bumba in Mongala District is thought to have been one of the worst hit areas, where local Red Cross officials say almost 400 houses have been destroyed. Floods have blocked importation supply routes in particular in south east parts of Équateur province. Radio Okapi say that, according to their sources, these floods are the strongest seen in the Central Basin since 1997.  Bas-Congo Province  Radio Okapi also report that a young child was killed and around 75 left homeless when flooding caused severe damage to houses in Lufu-Toto, Bas-Congo Province. Roads and bridges have also been damaged by floods in the province.  Rainfall  Comprehensive rainfall records for the country are unavailable.  Emmanuel Akweti told Reuters that precipitation levels this rainy season (October to April) were unusually high, with Kinshasa registering 450 mm (18 inches) of rainfall, or nearly a third of its annual average, between 17 November to 06 December alone.  The BBC says that satellite images from the area suggest that as much a month’s worth of rain may have fallen in the past week.  WMO report that, during a 24 hour period between 06 and 07 December 2015, 136.9 mm of rain fell in Bukavu in South Kivu province in the east of the country.  On 29 November 2015, Kinshasa recorded 132 mm of rain in 24 hours, and 68 mm the day before.  Previous Floods in Democratic Republic of Congo  At least 30 people died in floods in Kalehe Territory in South Kivu province after 3 days of heavy rain in late October 2014.  14 people died in March this year after flooding in Fizi, South Kivu province. 181\n",
      "Floods have made 20,000 families homeless and inundated the main water collection station, preventing access to drinkable water  KINSHASA, Dec 8 (Reuters) - At least 31 people have died in Democratic Republic of Congo's capital Kinshasa in the last three weeks in the worst flooding in years, the provincial interior minister said on Tuesday, warning conditions could get even worse.  The deaths since Nov. 17, concentrated in neighbourhoods along the Congo River and its tributary, the Ndjili, have resulted mainly from home collapses, Emmanuel Akweti said.  The flooding has made 20,000 families homeless and inundated the main water collection station, preventing two-thirds of Kinshasa's communes from accessing drinkable water, he added.  An employee at the public water utility said officials hoped to resume service there by Thursday.  Kinshasa, a sprawling city of more than 10 million people, has notoriously poor infrastructure, with improvised wooden shacks lining the waterfront and dirt roads that often flood with the first rainfall.  Akweti said that precipitation levels this rainy season - which runs from October to April - were unusually high with Kinshasa registering 450 millimetres (18 inches) of rainfall, or nearly a third of its annual average, between Nov. 17 and Dec. 6 alone.  He warned that weather forecasters were predicting above average rainfall through to February and urged all residents living in riverside areas to evacuate.  Congo's government has invested considerably in Kinshasa's infrastructure in recent years, but critics complain that the upgrades have almost exclusively targeted the city's upscale neighbourhoods and prominent landmarks.

      "Enrique Guevara in Panama    Heavy rain is not a new phenomenon in Andean region of South America. But despite the serious disruption the rains often cause to the lives and livelihoods of thousands, their ‘regularity’ means they’re often under-reported or fail to capture greater public attention.    In early 2012 Ecuador was hit by a series of intense storms causing floods, burst riverbanks and landslides. Volunteers from the Ecuadorian Red Cross immediately took action in the worst-hit provinces to rescue and evacuate affected people, provide pre-hospital care and psychosocial support, and assess the extent of the damage and needs.    Teresa Basurto is a mother of three. Her youngest son is 14 and studies over 300km from his home in La Armenia; her two older boys have married and left home. When a fierce storm hit the district, Teresa’s home was flooded and she lost her rice crops, chickens and pigs – her three main sources of income for the family.    Fortunately her home, made from cane and a zinc roof, withstood the battering but she was warned to stay away during the worst of the weather due to a risk of more flooding. A short period of evacuation, in which Teresa stayed with family, turned into a month and a half away from home.    Teresa remembers that the situation got worse because that she did not have a job, but with the help of friends who gave her rice seeds she was able to work again. Regaining this source of income was vital and allowed her to buy cured rice and use it as seed.    Teresa’s experience is far from unique. The National Secretariat for Risk Management in Ecuador says the storm affected over 121,000 people. More than 7,340 people had to evacuate their homes to stay in shelters or with family members. The floods damaged or destroyed homes, schools, roads, bridges and other crucial infrastructure.    With support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and funding from the European Commission’s Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO), the Ecuadorian Red Cross provided food assistance and hygiene kits and, spread messages on disease prevention and health promotion among families in the coastal provinces of Manabi, Los Rios and Guayas.    The effects of the storms on agriculture have a significant impact on a community’s ability to recover. Rodolfo Carriel is a farmer who lives in Bebo in the district of Salitre. He is a veteran of many floods, but the severity of the disaster in 2012 took him by surprise.    When the storm hit, Rodolfo was in the Community Committee of Salitre and responded to the emergency with friends from the Committee. A 20 meter wall collapsed causing a massive flood which left his family with no rice crops, no animals and a patch of land incapable of supporting his work. The family was devastated. “We were almost left homeless,” he says.    Along with emergency assistance, the Ecuadorian Red Cross also began preparing the communities for the risk of waterborne diseases such as dengue that can sometimes arise after significant flooding. “I feel very thankful because the help arrived just when we needed it,” Rodolfo says.    Teresa fears that if this year’s floods are as bad, the communities will not be fully prepared, but at least, through programmes supported by the Ecuadorian Red Cross, IFRC and ECHO, they are aware of the risks and know some of the things they can do to lessen the impact. 184\n"

      "El Comité de Operaciones de Emergencia (COE) del Carchi se activó la tarde de ayer, tras subir de alerta amarilla a naranja por el incremento en la actividad sísmica de los volcanes Chiles y Cerro Negro.  En los cantones Tulcán y Espejo se sintieron con más fuerza los temblores que tuvieron una magnitud de hasta 5,9 grados en la escala de Richter. Allí se hicieron evaluaciones de las afectaciones a casas y vías.    Uno de los daños de magnitud está en la carretera Tufiño- Maldonado, en el noroccidente de Tulcán. Ahí, 25 obreros del Ministerio de Transporte y Obras Públicas limpiaron la vía, pese a que el peligro continuaba latente, por la continua caída de rocas y tierra.    El bloqueo se registra a 13 km de Tufiño. Ahí, una retroexcavadora estaba estacionada junto a rocas de 1,50 m de altura. Más arriba, en el km 32, se escuchaban constantemente ruidos que llegaban desde la parte alta del cerro Chiles y causaban temor.    La cuadrilla vial suspendió los trabajos de reapertura del camino, en el tramo conocido como Lagunas Verdes–Potrerillos, a las 14:00 de ayer.    “La tierra tiembla mucho. No tenemos garantías para trabajar y debemos respetar la alerta naranja”, agregó Darwin Donoso, funcionario del Ministerio.    Junto a Lagunas Verdes, hay fisuras en la mesa de la carretera. Según los técnicos de Obras Públicas, está a punto de perderse la calzada de la única vía que enlaza a las parroquias de Tufiño y Maldonado.    Estos daños se produjeron porque la actividad en los volcanes Chiles, en Ecuador, y Cerro Negro, en Colombia, se reanudó desde el 29 de abril, según informó Mario Ruiz, director del Instituto Geofísico de la Politécnica Nacional.    “Dentro del volcán hay presiones. Nuestra tarea es ver cómo se van a manifestar esas reacciones, y cómo el magma está forzando para salir”.    Pese a que los obreros del Ministerio lograron habilitar un carril en la carretera para la circulación de ambulancias entre Tufiño y Maldonado o viceversa, el paso para vehículos y personas a pie está restringido por esta vía, por seguridad.    De acuerdo con Omar Chamorro, director provincial del Ministerio, se deben retirar piedras en una longitud de 20 km. Para entrar o salir de Maldonado, explicó, se puede usar la ruta alterna Chical-El Carmen.    Sin embargo, informó que en el km 25 hay un solo carril de circulación, debido a los continuos derrumbes que se producen por las lluvias.    Entre tanto, en el centro poblado de Tufiño, el patio de comidas del mercado fue cerrado al público, por prevención.    Las 12 vendedoras esperan que los eventos sísmicos no ahuyenten a los turistas. Se calcula que llegan entre 2 000 y  2 500 los fines de semana, según datos de la Junta Parroquial.  Ernesto Tatamués, teniente político de Tufiño, confirmó que las clases fueron suspendidas en la Unidad Educativa Los Ríos de esa parroquia.    Dos casas y la iglesia de la comuna de San Nicolás, otras dos en Santa Bárbara y una en Maspaz fueron afectadas por los fuertes remezones.    Jairo Enríquez, vecino de Chiles, en Colombia, dice en son de broma que estos poblados comparten la frontera hasta con los sismos.    En el cantón Espejo, en cambio, la situación es preocupante. El Cuerpo de Bomberos ordenó la evacuación de cinco familias por el peligro de que sus casas se caigan.    Los rescatistas contabilizaron 51 viviendas en todo el cantón que resultaron afectadas por los últimos temblores.    El alcalde Lenin Carrera manifestó que esperan el aporte de entidades del Gobierno Nacional, debido a que los recursos municipales son escasos. No obstante, utilizarán un fondo de emergencia para ayudar a las familias que lo necesiten.    En la parroquia La Libertad la situación es más crítica. Tres familias de los barrios San Isidro, Jesús del Gran Poder y Santa Teresita están a punto de perder sus viviendas.    Vitelma Pérez, vecina de El Ángel, decidió desde el lunes último pernoctar bajo una improvisada carpa que instaló en el patio de su casa. Su cocina está destruida. Los techos se desprendieron y hay varias paredes que están cuarteadas.    Los más afectados son los estudiantes de la Unidad Santa Mariana de Jesús, de El Ángel, donde las clases fueron suspendidas. La edificación tiene grandes grietas y las autoridades están preocupadas porque no tienen recursos para rehabilitar la infraestructura. Los padres de familia de los 278 alumnos están desconcertados.  En Tufiño y Espejo consideran que hay falta de respuesta de las autoridades. Los damnificados de Espejo se quejan de que no han llegado alimentos ni vituallas. Mientras que en Tufiño piden carpas ya que están durmiendo a la intemperie, abrigados solo con una fogata. 187\n",

      "Egypt has complied with international human rights law and has consulted with local residents while combating terrorism in Sinai, Egypt's new cabinet said in a press statement on Tuesday.  The statement, which sums up the efforts of the Egyptian government in Sinai over the past two years, said that residents subject to compulsory evacuation in North Sinai were surveyed to find out their preferred method of compensation.  The cabinet's statement came on the same day Human Rights Watch claimed that \"the mass home demolitions and forced eviction of about 3,200 families in the Sinai Peninsula …violated international law.\"  The US-based rights watchdog said in a report that Egypt can \"certainly protect itself from the insurgency and take action against the insurgents’ supply lines…in a way that does not arbitrarily harm civilians and violate their right to housing and their protections during forced evictions.”  For the past two years, Egypt has been combating a spike in a decade-long Islamist militant insurgency in North Sinai.  As part of its strategy to eliminate terrorism, the government evicted over 1,000 families and destroyed many houses, with the aim of creating a 1km-deep buffer zone along Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip.  Egyptian forces have also been destroying underground tunnels between Gaza and Egypt, which they say are used by militants to smuggle weapons into Egypt.  The cabinet statement added that the majority of the surveyed citizens who were evicted from their homes to create the buffer zone wanted their compensation in the form of cash, while a minority preferred replacement land and housing.  The infrastructure of New Rafah, designed to replace the parts of the city of Rafah which were demolished to create the buffer zone, is currently being completed to absorb all those citizens who want to move there, the statement added.  The statement also said that security forces adhered to “the principle of not opening fire on a potential threat unless the source of threat imminently threatens security forces.\"  Human Rights Watch argued that, based on interviews with North Sinai citizens, Egyptian authorities had \"provided residents with little or no warning of the evictions and no effective way to challenge their eviction, home demolition, or compensation.\"  The Human Rights Watch report also argues that Egypt has failed to use sophisticated tunnel-detecting technology, on which Egyptian personnel have been trained by the United States, in order to find and eliminate tunnels without destroying as many homes and buildings.  Cairo has repeatedly called Human Rights Watch's reports on the post-Morsi situation in Egypt biased.  Short link:   191\n",
      "By THE CAIRO POST  CAIRO: Heavy rain for two consecutive days in Egypt caused strong floods and damage in different governorates In Egypt. The rains on Sunday and Monday flooded 35 acres of agricultural land in 15 different village in Asyut and displaced hundreds of citizens since the floods destroyed the dams previously built by the army forces in Wady Al-Sheikh.  Secretary of education Directorate of Asyut said that 99 schools were suspended, which left 28,000 students at their homes in the governorate, because of the floods.  Asyut governor General Ibrahim Hammad visited the affected areas to make sure that there are no human losses. He will coordinate with Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab, promising to compensate the affected houses and agricultural lands.  There was an accident in Asyut on Thursday night when two vehicles collided due to the remnant water, mud puddles, and high speed. Twenty passengers died and two were injured on the Cairo – Asyut desert road.  “There will be appropriate will to those affected by the floods,” Hammad said on Monday evening during his phone interview on CBC Extra channel.  Hamad said the damages are yet to be determined, stressing that many areas in Asyut are now suffering due to the floods, especially in the Wady Al-Sheikh district.  No causalities were reported up until now and government will compensate people who lost their houses or lands, Hamad emphasized.  In Luxor, 147 houses were affected by the floods, most of them with cracks in the ceiling, according to Governor of Luxor Alaa Al-Harass. Some civil societies managed to provide immediate aid for those affected by the floods, mostly with rations and blankets.  Governor of North Sinai Khaled Fouda said the international road was opened again on Monday after suspension due to the floods since rocks and sand were falling on it because of the rains. Youm7 reported the collapse of four houses and some sidelines in the governorate.  In Sohag , Youm7 reported that small dams collapsed in 1994, which were built only with rocks with no cement. They violate the technical standards, which is why they were not able to resist the floods which affected agricultural lands and homes in the governorate.  Governor of Sohag Mahmoud Ateeq said that floods caused three cuts in the Sohag – Red Sea bridge as a result of torrential rain and the rush of severe floods, adding that the road gates are closed until they are completely repaired.  In the Red Sea governorate, roads were flooded and vehicles traffic was suspended in the road from Raas Ghareb to Hurghada for 15 kilometers. Hurghada International Airport witnessed a crisis when an electricity blackout due to leaked water from the ceiling.  Nine were killed and 35 injured in a bus accident in Hurghada on Saturday due to the bad weather.  Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab held a meeting with the Ministers of Housing, of Transport, and both Cairo and Giza governors to discuss the current situation and how to deal with the floods.  Mahlab assigned the Arab contractors company to find engineering solutions to prevent the accumulation of rain water in tunnels in priority areas, which causes traffic congestion.  Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Mohamed Abdul Muttalib ended his visit to Uganda prematurely after one. He came back to Egypt to follow up on the situation in the affected governorates.  Generally all governorates were assigned companies and governmental vehicles to clear water floods so the traffics could return to normal again. 192\n"

      "Haikota, 09 August 2013 – Reports indicated that heavy rainfall and the damaging of a major diversion canal in Hashenkit area have caused flooding on the 5th of this month in Haikota sub-zone, thus giving rise to the destruction of 20 residential houses and the washing away of property.  Among the inhabitants, Mr. Mohammed Kerar and Ms. Letemichael Asgedom pointed out that the area has been witnessing fool river floods since the end of July in line with the consistency of heavy rains, and called on the inhabitants in general and herdsmen in particular to practice caution in this connection.  Accordingly, the timing of the flood which occurred at night was a disadvantage for the inhabitants in case of the efforts made to save property.  Mr. Tadese Negash from the Public Technique Service Center in Gash-Barka region disclosed that the available machineries were deployed in the rescuing endeavor.  Mr. Adem Humed, Administrator of Haikota semi-urban center, called for immediate renovation of the destroyed diversion canal, and advised the residents to be vigilant in case of similar incident in the future as heavy showers may continue.       198\n",
      "Update: 17:32, 15 October 2014 Wednesday  Floods displace 8,000 Ethiopian families  World Bulletin/News Desk  Some 8,000 families have been displaced by the recent overflowing of Ethiopia's Awash River across the country, the Ministry of Water, Energy and Irrigation said Wednesday.  \"Households are being moved to higher ground and given temporary shelter,\" ministry spokesperson Bizuneh Tolcha told Anadolu Agency, asserting that no casualties had been reported thus far.  \"The Ministry of Defense, UNICEF and other donor organizations are working in collaboration with the ministry in an effort to distribute food aid and other materials to the displaced,\" Tolcha said.  \"Food aid, medicine, canopies and other household utensils are being dropped from the air by Defense Ministry helicopters,\" the spokesperson added.  He went on to note that cotton and sugarcane fields, covering more than 5,200 hectares of land, had also been flooded.  Efforts are currently underway to repair a dike that was breached by the floodwaters, he said, adding that all necessary equipment – including heavy trucks, excavators and bulldozers – had already been dispatched to the area.  Repairing the dike would serve to minimize flood damage in other areas, Tolcha said.  The flooding came in the wake of heavy rainfall, measured at between 45 and 91 millimeters, he added.  The Awash River has its source in the central Ethiopian highlands, West of Addis Ababa, and flows towards the Rift Valley. Its basin covers an area of 110,000 square kilometers in Ethiopia's Oromia, Afar and Amhara regions. 199\n",

      "/ Front page / News  ABOUT 800 people who are badly affected by the depression over the Central and Eastern parts of Viti Levu are still living within the confines of evacuation centres after most of them lost their belongings from the floods on Thursday and Friday last week.  Although a number of evacuation centres have closed, 17 still remain open and are housing evacuees, many of whom are from the highlands of Naitasiri.  \"The number we've given (about 800) are the number of the villagers — the population of the villages basically.  \"They are staying in community halls and churches at the moment,\" explained National Disaster Management Office director Manasa Tagicakibau in an interview yesterday.  Mr Tagicakibau said : \"Most of the evacuation centres have closed, the figure we have is that 10 have closed and 17 are still open.\"  He said the NDMO response teams worked hard throughout the weekend to get relief rations to the evacuees.  \"Response teams are moving into these evacuation centres to at least provide them with some relief rations because most of the people who came into the evacuation centres — because their houses were flooded — they came in with nothing but the clothes on their backs.  \"But relief rations are to the evacuation centres only though, not to the community at large — just the centres and we provided rations to sustain them for at least two days.\"  He said the office was working to get the evacuees back on their feet and close down all evacuation centres by tomorrow at the latest. 201\n",
      "Image: Tuomas Hirvonen / Yle  Rapidly moving ice floes choking the local river have caused flooding in the Pyhäjoki downtown area. Officials say the situation may worsen if the natural ice dams aren’t broken up.  Emergency service workers have evacuated about 30 people from the flooded areas. Nine detached homes, two terraced homes and two summer cottages have been inundated by overflows from the river.  “People simply didn’t have time to leave their homes before the water came up the stairs and even into their homes,” said head of Pyhäjoki rescue services Jarmo Haapanen.  Several outdoor annexes in the area were also damaged in the rapidly rising flood waters, however no one was reported injured so far.  Rescue officials were busy building flood barriers to protect buildings in the flooding zone. Backup for the operation was provided by Border Guard helicopter patrols, which provided aerial surveillance.  “There is a risk that if the ice dam moves on and then gets stuck again, there will be flooding in a new area,” Haapanen explained.  The city of Pyhäjoki has set up temporary care facilities and emergency accomodation for residents evacuated from their homes. Those in need of housing should call 040 3596 053 or 040 3596 001.

      "France has been suffering from floods throughout May, 2013. On May 4 in the Burgundy region, torrential rain resulted in some residents of the city of Dijon being evacuated,. Levels of the River Ouche were rising rapidly after about 1 month’s worth of rain had poured in just under 12 hours until it eventually burst its banks. Three people were reported to be trapped in their homes, but were later rescued by the emergency services. Also early in May water levels of the Saône river in Lyon were particularly high, as were the Isère and Rhône near Valence.  Floods are still occurring in France more than a week later. On May 9 the historic town of Troyes was hit by flooding. Troyes lies 170 km from Paris, in the Aube department (administrative region) which remained on “Orange” alert (warnings issued by the French national meteorological serviceMétéo France). Orange is the second highest flood alert. The Marne, Meuse and Seine-et-Marne departments remain on yellow alert.  France has already suffered from serious flooding this year. In Mach a state of emergency was declared as floods hit the south western Pyrenees Orientales region. Here the levels of the River Agly were so high, forecasters feared they would reach the levels of the worst floods on 1999. Flooding was so bad in March 2013 that a woman motorist was killed near Perpignan as her car was swept away by the flood waters of the river. About 700 residents were evacuated from their homes in the area at the foot of the Pyrenees. Flooding also hit the Rhone Valley in south east France.  Source: RFI; UPI ; The Connexion 207\n"

      "Violent storms and flooding send water cascading through Antibes, Cannes and Nice, inundating a retirement home and killing three people inside  Nineteen people are feared dead after violent storms and severe flooding swept the French Riviera, including three people who drowned in a retirement home after a river broke its banks.    Heavy flooding along the Côte d’Azur on Saturday saw the river Brague burst its banks close to the city of Antibes, flooding a home for elderly people.  The French president, François Hollande, confirmed at least 16 people had died and three were missing. The interior ministry said earlier in the morning there was little hope of finding the missing people alive.  “It’s not over,” Hollande said as he arrived at the flooded retirement home and met emergency service workers. “The toll is not yet finalised. In times like this, we must be fast, efficient and coordinated.” He warned locals to take care on local roads, which are covered with slippery mud.  At least seven people drowned after their cars became trapped in underground car parks, according to rescue teams in Mandelieu-la Napoule, with the commune’s mayor, Henri Leroy, warning more bodies may be found.  “It’s apocalyptic,” he told Agence France-Presse. “The parking was half-emptied but there are thousands of vehicles. There could be more bodies.”  Three people drowned when their car became stuck in rising waters inside a narrow tunnel near Vallauris Golfe-Juan, authorities said.  A woman in her 60s is reported to have died in the street in Cannes when huge storms hit the region on Saturday. Water and debris coursed down roads in the festival town and in the neighbouring city of Nice. Another victim was found dead at a campsite in Antibes, according to officials.  More than 17cm (6.7in) of rain fell on the Cannes region in two hours, radio France Bleu Azur reported.  Obama declares state of emergency in South Carolina over floods Read more  Guardian journalist Stuart Dredge, attending the MIPJunior television conference in Cannes, said the venue for the event had been flooded. He said he had walked knee-deep in water on his way home on Saturday night after watching the England-Australia Rugby World Cup match.  “By half time, the street outside was running with water, and the main Rue d’Antibes road in Cannes was between ankle and knee-deep at its lower points,” he said.  “The crossroads were the most dangerous parts: the water really was pouring down from the higher ground with strong currents – and a fair few people walking home had been drinking, so their balance would have been a bit impaired already.”  Stuart Dredge (@stuartdredge) Seriously though, this is the state of Cannes' main thoroughfare right now pic.twitter.com/xk2V429l9X  Dredge said he did not see anyone fall into the water, although some moped drivers needed assistance. “This morning, there are a few cars that have clearly been swept along and deposited leaning against railings. When I got home the power was out in my building, but it came back on again shortly before midnight.  “I think Cannes probably got off lightly, comparably. It was a hairy walk home, but I didn’t feel in true danger,” he added.  Flooding in Cannes  “Some cars were carried off into the sea,” said Cannes’ mayor, David Lisnard, describing water levels reaching halfway up car doors and trees left uprooted on the city’s main street.    “We have rescued a lot of people, and we must now be vigilant against looting,” he added, announcing that an emergency plan to mobilise police, emergency responders and municipal services.  British journalist Sarah Kovandzich said she was in Le Crillon bar a few streets back from the seafront when she and her companions saw water running past the door.  “I’ve never seen anything like it in Cannes,” she said. “The water started to seep into the bar, then we were up to our ankles, people were putting their feet up on the chairs. Outside, you could see plant pots and flowers just being carried along the road by the water.”  Kovandzich said the walk home was daunting because the flooding had removed manhole covers. “You couldn’t immediately see where the holes might be because of the flowing water.”  The power was out in her apartment and water was dripping through the ceiling, she said.  One social media user compared the scenes in Cannes on Sunday morning to the zombie TV series The Walking Dead, posting pictures of several damaged cars.  Jer Crunchant ™ (@jercrunchant) Les rues de #Cannes ont un air de \"The Walking Dead\" ce matin, sauf que ce n'est pas de la fiction #jamaisvuca pic.twitter.com/dFACFwtM0Q  France’s interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, was also due to visit the area on Sunday morning to inspect rescue efforts, his spokesman said.  Hollande thanked rescuers and politicians for their work, praising the “solidarity of the nation” and offering condolences to the victims’ families, while the prime minister, Manuel Valls, spoke of his “deep emotion” on hearing of the deaths.  The Elysée palace announced on Sunday that victims of the flooding will receive help from the state under a French law that gives compensation to victims of natural disasters. A tweet from the president’s office said it would be paid within three months.  The areas worst hit by flooding were also the hardest to access, officials said, raising fears the death toll could rise. About 27,000 homes remained without power early on Sunday, 14,000 of them in Cannes.  French rail company SNCF said about a dozen trains carrying hundreds of people had to be halted for safety reasons, while roads around Antibes were also flooded, according to French emergency services. Train services are still cancelled between Toulon and Nice, a spokesman said on Sunday, adding that further delays are likely.  “Campsites are under water, and two helicopters are circling to ensure the public’s security, as some people are stuck on the roof of their caravans,” said a spokeswoman for the fire brigade.  Up to 500 tourists, including several Britons and Danes, sought shelter overnight at Nice airport, while a Nice versus Nantes football match was interrupted by the downpours.  French weather forecasters said the worst storms had now passed over the French mainland and were heading for the Italian coast.  More than 120 people are staying in temporary shelters in Cannes, according to city authorities. Donations for those who have lost belongings in the floods are being organised in an emergency drive by French charity Secours Populaire. 216\n"

      "Period covered by this update:  26 July – 2 August 2013  Summary: On 25th July 2013, CHF 121,847 CHF was initially allocated from the IFRC’s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the Georgia Red Cross Society in delivering immediate assistance to 380 families (1900 beneficiaries). Due to the continuation of the adverse weather conditions and newly arisen needs, however, the National Society has now revised its operational plans together with its budget. The revised total budget for this operation amounts to CHF 215,194. Based on the most recent needs assessment, a total of 680 families (3400 beneficiaries) will thus be targeted throughout Georgia. Unearmarked funds to repay DREF are encouraged.  On 19th and few days later, on 29th July 2013, extended heavy rains caused considerable damages in several parts of Georgia. A total of 4,800 families (24,000 people) have been affected in the following regions Samegrelo, Guria, Ajara, Mtskheta - Mtianeti. The western part of Georgia was the most affected. In Samegrelo region more than 20 villages and Senaki town were severely affected by the floods.  Houses, agricultural lands, gardens and yards were flooded. Cattle and poultry were killed. Cracks appeared in walls of the houses and traffic movement was severely affected. Heavy rain also significantly affected eastern part of Georgia, as well: seven villages of Dusheti municipality were isolated from the outside world and more than 20 villages were severely affected. The amount of inflicted damage is being assessed.  Based on the initial needs assessed and on the official request for support for Zugdidi municipality, Senaki town in Samegrelo region and Dusheti municipality in Mtskheta-Mtianeti region GRCS is planning to assist 13 villages (250 families) in Zugdidi Municipality, 300 families in Senaki town and 7 villages (130 families) in Dusheti Municipality.  The Georgia Red Cross Society is now aiming to assist 680 families (3,400 beneficiaries) with food and non-food items (NFI), i.e. food parcels, mattresses, blankets, kitchen sets, and hygiene kits. This operation is expected to be implemented over three months, and will therefore be completed by 1 November 2013; the Final Report will be made available three months after the end of the operation (by 1 February 2014). 219\n",

      "The estimate is a composite of figures reported by the government of Georgia, UNHCR, and the UN Inter-Agency Humanitarian Assessment Mission to South Ossetia.  The government reported in December 2014 that it had registered 262,704 people as IDPs. This number is based on results from a re-registration exercise conducted in 2013-2014 by the Ministry of IDPs from the Occupied Territories, Accommodation and Refugees. The figure is a slight increase from the initial figure released after the re-registration exercise for two reasons. First, some IDPs failed to participate in the re-registration process in 2013 and consequently had their status terminated. They are now gradually approaching the Ministry in order to re-register and have their statuses restored. Second, children with one IDP parent are entitled to the status. Each month about 400-500 newborns receive the status, which causes an increase in the IDP figure.  Most IDPs were displaced in the early 1990s as a result of conflict in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, while a smaller number were displaced during conflict with the Russian Federation over South Ossetia in August 2008.  The number of IDPs registered by the government includes people who have returned home to Abkhazia, but does not include people displaced within Abkhazia and South Ossetia. No official survey has been conducted there by the Georgian authorities as these regions are not under its control.  The IDMC estimate of 232,700 internally displaced is arrived at by:  deducting from the official government figure of 262,704  At least 45,000 IDPs who have spontaneously returned to Abkhazia (UNHCR, 31 July 2009)  and adding:  Some 5,000 IDPs still displaced within South Ossetia as a result of the 1991-1992 conflict (UN HRC, 14 January 2010)  At least 10,000 IDPs in South Ossetia displaced due to the 2008 conflict (United Nations Inter-agency Humanitarian Assessment Mission to South Ossetia, 2008).  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it. 221\n",

Reuters witnesses said the blaze had damaged at least three homes at a hamlet by the town of Marathon - the site of the historic 490 BC battle between Athenians and Persians about 40 kilometres (25 miles) northeast of the Greek capital.  \"The flames have reached homes, but we don't know yet how many are threatened,\" said a fire brigade official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  About 50-60 people were evacuated from their holiday homes in the area, according to a police official. Live television footage showed a thick cloud of black smoke billowing into the air as the fire consumed low vegetation.  More than 60 firefighters and volunteers, supported by dozens of fire engines, four aircraft and four helicopters, battled flames that spread on several fronts. The fire brigade said it would reinforce the teams on the ground.  Summer wildfires are frequent in Greece, often sparked by soaring temperatures, gale force winds, drought, accidents or arson. Greece's worst wildfires in living memory in 2007 killed 65 people over 10 days.  (Reporting by Yannis Behrakis, writing by Renee Maltezou; editing by Mike Collett-White) 225\n"

      "Last update: February 5, 2014 at 5:11 pm by By  Earthquake-report.com is a independent NGO website who only survives because of (mostly small) PRIVATE DONATIONS. Your gift will be highly appreciated. This page will automatically refresh every 30 minutes as we might be adding updates (mostly, but not exclusively for earthquakes with a damaging potential). Keep it open in a browser tab.  –  Update February 5 :  A scientific team, including 100 engineers along with seismologists and engineers from the Technical Chamber of Greece, have already come to the island to inspect all public buildings. According to first estimates, around 600 buildings are deemed demolished, 1,100 heavy damaged and 1,400 with minor damage throughout the region of Palliki while there are several problems in public infrastructure such as roads, ports and public buildings that need restoration.  Update Jan. 27, 10:33 UTC: Seven people suffered minor injuries due to falling objects, officials said. More than 2000 people (temporarily) had to leave their damaged houses.  Update 19:20 UTC: The strong aftershock was also felt in parts of Albania (Tirana) and Italy. A second quake, M 4.2, followed at 19:12 UTC.  Update 19:12 UTC: The revised data from greek authorities say the aftershock had M 5.2. Stong enough to cause new damage and make the night even more uncomfortable. Another shock, M 4.2, followed 15 minutes later. (More Info about the aftershock here)  Update 19:09 UTC: News from the mainshock: At least 2 people are confirmed to be slightly injured. They went to the hospital in Argostoli. Due to the damage caused to tis hospital, mainly to its roof, it was decided to evacuate it. Patients were transferred to the next wooden building.  Update 18:56 UTC: The new quake (aftershock), happening at 18:45 UTC, is specified with Magnitude 4.9 by greek authorities (preliminary data).  Update 18:48 UTC: A new quake, preliminary M 5.6, happened a few minutes ago!  Update 17:59 UTC: Schools across Cephalonia will be closed Monday in order for the necessary verifications of the building structures to be made.  Update 16:59 UTC: Nearly every building in Lixouri suffered at least minor damage. Many buildings, esspecially pubic buildings like schools, show severe damage like collapsed walls and roofs. Other places on Cephalonia, for example the airport, are also affected. Authorities are working to organize a save supply of food and water for the earthquake victims. Most of them won't return to their homes and stay outside during the coming night.  Update 16:48 UTC: Some people are treated in the hospital of Argostoli for minor injuries, mainly caused by falling objects / debris and broken glass.  Update 15:44 UTC: One house in Kounopetra collapsed, luckily without affecting people. An relatively large ash emission of the volcano Etna on Sicily (Italy) followed shortly after this quake was felt there. A connection of both events is possible.  Update 15:18 UTC: Also the neighbour island Zakynthos (south of Cephalonia) reports minor damage to buildings, mainly broken windows.  Update 15:04 UTC: The greek Secretary of Interior is going to visit the earthquake area later today. Newspapers report that Lixouri is the most affected area. Many houses there suffered damage in diverse extent. No injuries or collapsed houses so far, but the quake also caused rockfalls and minor landslides in parts of the island!  Update 14:53 UTC: Power supply is interrupted in Fiskardo, located in northern Cephalonia. More damage reports coming in from different parts of the Island, so far \"only\" bricks falling from walls, cracks and other limited damage, but it seems that several buildings are affected. In Lixouri a hospice and some homes were demolished.  Update 14:48 UTC: Damaged buildings are reported from Lixouri, located only 6 km from the epicenter. No details about the damage are available yet.  Update 14:37 UTC: First reports mentioning cracked roads and a chaotic situation on Cephalonia. Most people were frightened by the earthquake and ran to the streets. Fire brigade and police are checking for possible damaged buildings and injuries.  Update 14:33 UTC: So far, 2 aftershocks with M 4.1 and 4.2 were registered. More are expected to follow. People on Cephalonia should be prepared for it. Residents of Kefalonia are scared. This event reminded them about the great earthquake of 1953 (M 7.2), where hundreds of people lost their lives.  Update 14:29 UTC: The magnitude was revised to 5.8. A shallow depth of only 17 km is given by greek authorities. Quakes with this magnitude and shallow depth happening in populated locations can cause heavy damage, esspecially to buildings with poor construction.  Update 14:21 UTC: People report the shaking also from distant countries, like Albania, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Southern Italy.  A strong quake with magnitude 5.7 shook the greek island Cephalonia a few minutes ago. The shocks were also felt in Athens. The epicenter is located in the western part of the island. We expect some damage caused by this earthquake.

      "A landslide caused by recent heavy rain has prompted disaster management authorities in Guatemala to evacuate over 300.  The landslide occurred during the morning of Saturday, 11 July 2015, in the municipality of Chinautla, in the department of Guatemala. The country’s disaster management agency, CONRED, say that the landslide completely destroyed 10 houses and damaged 11 others. A further 49 homes are thought to be at risk, prompting CONRED to evacuate 350 people in total.  Around 46 of those displaced are currently staying in a local community hall, while the rest have found temporary accommodation with family or friends.  No deaths or injuries have been reported. CONRED have distributed blankets and sleeping mats, hygiene kits and clean water to those affected by the landslide.  More Rain Forecast  Guatemala’s meteorological department INSIVUMEH said that northern areas of the country could see more than 40mm of rain in the next 24 hours. Currently three rivers or lakes in the northern Petén Department are above normal maximum levels: Río La Pasión, Lago Petén Itzá, and Rìo Usumacinta.  INSIVUMEH also warned that further heavy rainfall is likely from Wednesday 15 July, especially in southern and central regions.  Heavy rain across parts of central America over the last 2 weeks has also affected Nicaragua where the Escondido river has overflowed in El Rama, and Costa Rica, where over 1,000 people have been evacuated after over 2 weeks of flooding. 230\n",

      "This figure includes 242,000 IDPs who were displaced during the civil conflict. This specific number is based upon estimates published by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in 1997. Since then, updated figures on internal displacement have not been gathered at the country level.  The government pledged to address the specific needs and vulnerabilities of IDPs within its general anti-poverty interventions. However, at the end of 2007 the government had not agreed on criteria to include IDPs in a national reparation programme and it is unclear how many people can still be considered as displaced, if any.  The total figure, however, does not take into account organized groups of displaced people, nor it includes disaster-induced displacement figure, which as of December 2013 was of 93 IDPs who were displaced by an earthquake.  Displacement is a result of the conflict that opposed the government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity armed group. Between 1981 and 1983 when violence reached its most critical stage, the Guatemalan government launched operations tierra arrasada (“obliterated earth”), which meant to massacre entire communities in order to eliminate potential cooperation between the armed groups and their social base. As a consequence massive displacements occurred. The conflict towards 1997, after the signature of several peace agreements, and left between 500,000 and 1.5 million people displaced, most of them indigenous.  Many of the country’s IDPs have returned or resettled in areas where they live under similar conditions as before they were displaced. Many face extreme poverty and marginalisation.  In addition, there is evidence of new displacement caused by organized crime, street gangs and maras, as well as other territorial conflicts associated with illegal resources exploitation and land appropriation. Although there are no official figures about these new displacements, there is evidence of forced evictions carried out in 2011.  Furthermore, drug trafficking organisations and gangs seeking strategic territory in order to extract palm oil and smuggle merchandise through the border, forcibly displaced 470 families from Peten. In total, the press reported that 350 families have been displaced by violence.  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it. 235\n",
      "—Entonces, ¿aquí es donde viven ustedes, los narcotraficantes?  —Aquí mismo, mire usté. Venga, le voy a presentar a toda la gente –me dice Venustiano.  Retira el alambre del palo y deja caer la portezuela. Asoman un viejito minúsculo y arrugado y un hombre recio que termina de bañarse a guacaladas en medio del patio. Morenos, tostados. El viejito dice algo en lengua quekchí, y de las champas comienzan a salir mujeres, muchas mujeres ancianas, y niños, unos 20 niños.  Esto es el departamento de Petén, al norte de Guatemala, los arrabales de un municipio llamado La Libertad. Para llegar hasta aquí hemos dejado atrás el bullicio del mercado, nos hemos alejado de cualquier punto de tuc-tuc, esas motocicletas con carcasa que hacen de taxis, y nos hemos internado por una vereda polvosa y reseca. El predio es del tamaño de media cancha de fútbol, y acoge siete champas desperdigadas, todas de plástico, cartón y palos. En medio del predio hay un charco grisáceo y espeso, con restos de comida. Huele a animal muerto. En una de las champas se cocina el almuerzo sobre un enorme comal. Sobre el comal, el almuerzo: tortillas y más tortillas.  Todas las personas se reúnen alrededor de Venustiano. Están sucias. Los niños, raquíticos y panzones. No dicen nada porque muy pocos pueden hablar castellano. Me ven y esperan.  —¿Ustedes son los narcotraficantes de Centro Uno?  —Nosotros somos –me contesta Venustiano, el líder de los moribundos–, ¿qué le parece?  —No sé qué decirle, Venustiano.  La puerta de oro  Las autoridades de México llaman al estado norteño de Sonora la puerta de oro hacia Estados Unidos. Allí están las rutas antiguas del contrabando, y allí viven y prosperan sin esconderse quienes manejan esos negocios. Bajo esa misma lógica, Petén podría bautizarse como la puerta de oro centroamericana hacia México.  El Informe lo deja bien claro; ya verán.  Petén es el departamento más vasto de Guatemala: más de 35 mil kilómetros cuadrados, una extensión que casi duplica la de El Salvador. Petén comparte 600 kilómetrosde de frontera con México y es un territorio en el que abundan los ríos y las selvas. Las autoridades militares guatemaltecas tienen claro que es el tramo de frontera más problemático del país. La fórmula que aplican es que mientras más se acerque la frontera al Océano Pacífico, más se puede hablar de migrantes, de contrabando de mercaderías, de grupos criminales locales, de prostíbulos de la trata, de machetes y pistolas. En cambio, mientras más se acerque a Petén, más se trata de grupos transnacionales, armas de asalto y vínculos políticos.  Las similitudes entre Petén y Sonora no se limitan a ser la sede principal de las grandes ligas del crimen organizado de los respectivos países; también se parecen por sus características demográficas. Un terreno con zonas solo accesibles por aire o en poderosos vehículos y, por tanto, despobladas. Mientras que Guatemala tiene en promedio 132 habitantes por kilómetro cuadrado, esa cifra en Petén es de apenas 16.  Aquí las extensiones se miden en una medida llamada caballería, que equivale a 64 manzanas o a 45 hectáreas.  La región sur de Petén es una zona, cada vez más, de amplias extensiones privadas donde empresas transnacionales siembran caballerías y caballerías de palma africana. Son una especie de palmeras chicas de las que se obtiene el aceite vegetal que, si bien apenas se consume en Centroamérica, es con el que más se cocina en el mundo entero. Justo en la franja central del departamento, delgada en proporción con el resto, se extiende de sur a norte una tira urbana que en sus extremos laterales se despuebla y deja paso a lo verde e indómito, a las caballerías de familias acusadas de estar vinculadas con el crimen organizado hasta por el propio Álvaro Colom, el presidente de la República. Y en la parte alta, una franja –menos gruesa que la de palma africana pero más que la urbana– que está repleta de reservas forestales protegidas donde no se puede deforestar sin permisos especiales. Al menos eso es lo que dice la ley. Petén está despoblado porque en su mayoría o es privado o restringido para el cultivo y la construcción.  Ese cariz privado y latifundista de las tierras peteneras responde no solo a las reservas protegidas, sino también a la acumulación de caballerías por parte de las grandes empresas de palma africana y de los grupos criminales. Así se dice en el Informe.  Todo este entramado complejo es el que ha llevado a Venustiano y su gente a vivir en champas que circundan un charco que huele a animal muerto y aún así ser etiquetados como narcotraficantes.  Vos o tu viuda  Los que saben cómo funciona este lugar parecen estar convencidos de que hay ojos y orejas por todas partes. Antes de subir a Petén, pasé una semana para amarrar fuentes confiables que me recibieran. Desde ciudad de Guatemala conversé con cinco personas que viven o vivieron aquí. Conseguí un contacto de unos religiosos que me pidieron que bajo ninguna condición se me ocurriera visitarlos en Petén. Pero ese contacto aceptó hablar con la premisa de detalles a cambio de anonimato.  La cita es hoy. Nos reunimos en Santa Elena, el más poblado de los municipios de la franja urbana, en una oficina donde un potente ventilador nos salva del pesado calor y de los mosquitos. Él es un respetado activista que trabaja en coordinación con decenas de organizaciones de la sociedad civil.  Por estos días, los medios de alcance nacional hablan de Petén en sus portadas por una única razón. Allá en el Parque Nacional Sierra del Lacandón, en la frontera con México, acaba de ser desalojada una comunidad de campesinos que usurpaba esos terrenos supuestamente prohibidos para los humanos. En las notas, el ministro de Gobernación, Carlos Menocal, relaciona el desalojo con el narco, y los medios televisivos celebran el duro golpe al narcotráfico de la zona que se ha dado al retirar a esas 300 familias que trabajaban para los apellidos renombrados por estos lares.  —Otra vez desalojaron a los narcos –dice el hombre con el que hablo, y se echa a reír.  Le pregunto el porqué de la risa.  —Con lo que se teje por acá, tener el descaro de decir que ellos son… En fin. De aquí todos los periodistas se van creyendo que contaron algo sobre el narco, y apenas han hablado de un grupo de campesinos pobres. Gente que ha perdido sus tierras, muchos a los que se las han arrebatado y que se van buscando dónde diablos cosechar su maíz, su frijol, sus pepitas. Y cuando encuentran un lugar allá perdido los acusan de narcos, los desalojan y los dejan tirados en cualquier parte, mendigando.  —Pero ellos invaden tierras prohibidas –hago de abogado del diablo.  —Y usted y yo lo haríamos. ¿No le digo que no tienen dónde cultivar, pues? ¿Y si solo eso saben hacer? Claro, si usted no tiene nada, si sabe que pronto le quitarán su siembra y su tierra y un señor le dice que por 1,500 quetzales (unos 190 dólares) descargue o cargue una avioneta, ¿qué haría?  Sobra la respuesta.  —No son poquitos los hijos que tiene un campesino –dice el activista, y ríe de nuevo.  Le digo que quiero hablar con ellos, con los campesinos, los supuestos narcotraficantes. Vuelve a reír. Lo hace como con hartazgo, como quejándose de mi ingenuidad. Dice que para ir a hablar con los que ocupan tierras, hay que meterse en terrenos demasiado vigilados por el crimen organizado. Además, dice, no sé si le hablarán, están hartos de que los periodistas los busquen con la misma pregunta: ¿ustedes trabajan para el narco? Dice que lo mejor es hablar con comunidades ya desalojadas.  En 1959 inició un plan para poblar Petén, para integrarlo en el país y para explotar su potencial agrícola. Se entregaron tierras a grandes empresarios, pero también a pequeños campesinos que podían cultivar.  —Sí –dice el activista–, y durante un tiempo los campesinos cultivaron sus cosechas y se las comieron y vivieron de eso. Vinieron de todas partes del país, pero hablamos de mediados del siglo pasado. No había carreteras buenas y no interesaba tanto acumular tierra. Muchos empresarios tenían grandes propiedades, pero no las ocupaban.  —¿Y qué cambió?  —Que hoy dos carreteras comunican Petén con el país, y que desde el año 2000 se vino con fuerza la palma africana, y los árboles maderables, teca y melina, y entonces la parcelita del campesino se volvió interesante para muchos. Ah, claro, y el acceso fácil por tierra a Petén hizo que narcotraficantes y contrabandistas y otros señores se interesaran más por acumular tierras fronterizas con México.  —En todo caso, lo que me dice es que los campesinos vendieron sus tierras.  —Hay formas y formas de vender. Le explico: si un abogado de una empresa lo visita una y otra vez hablándole de sumas de cinco números, y usted es un campesino quekchí, le brillan los ojos y vende sin saber nada. Si usted es un campesino, indígena o no, y los narcos quieren su tierra, entonces está más jodido, porque solo le avisarán que usted va a vender a una cantidad, y punto.  —¿Y si uno se niega?  —Hubo una frase famosa aquí a principios de la década: si vos no querés vender, tu viuda va a vender barato.  Este activista sabe de lo que habla. Recibe cada mes a decenas de campesinos que han sido presionados para vender, y asesora a los que no les pagan lo acordado o simplemente no entienden lo que dice su contrato de venta, porque no leyeron la letra chica o porque no saben leer.  El meollo del discurso de este activista se puede resumir en un Estado que ocupa dos varas para castigar: es implacable con los débiles, aparenta con ellos que es un Estado fuerte, y deja en paz a los verdaderos rivales de peso.  —Guatemala recibe fondos privados y de organismos internacionales para la protección de reservas y zonas arqueológicas. ¿Dónde muestra fuerza el Estado para aparentar ante esos donantes? Con los más débiles, a los que además acusa de narcotraficantes, lo que lo hace quedar mejor aun.  El activista vuelve a reír fuerte y con sarcasmo.  —Mire, nosotros nos metemos en esa zona, hablamos con esos campesinos y sabemos perfectamente que familias renombradas de narcotraficantes como los Mendoza, los León y los Lorenzana tienen grandes extensiones en reservas protegidas como los parques nacionales Sierra del Lacandón y Laguna del Tigre.  Y eso no solo él lo sabe. Incluso informes gubernamentales confirman que, parafraseando lo que en su día dijo monseñor Óscar Arnulfo Romero, las leyes en Petén son como las serpientes, que solo muerden a los que caminan descalzos. El Informe también lo explicita.  Los militares y el Informe  El viento sopla con fuerza en este café de la Zona18 de ciudad de Guatemala. Alrededor revolotean las servilletas que el chiflón arrebata a las mesas vacías. Desde esta terraza se ve los tejados de las casas de varias colonias de la clase media-baja. A pesar del frío, escogimos sentarnos aquí por privilegiar el aislamiento.  El coronel Díaz Santos pide un té negro. Lo conocí a principios de año, cuando era el segundo al mando de los militares en el estado de sitio con el que el presidente guatemalteco intentó frenar la entrada de Los Zetas a Alta Verapaz, el departamento ubicado al sur de Petén. El coronel ahora es el encargado de la Fuerzade Tarea Norte de Petén, que cubre Sayaxché, el municipio por excelencia de la palma africana y del trasiego de droga por el río La Pasión, rodeado por caballerías de las renombradas familias chapinas del narco. También se encarga del suroeste petenero, que cubre parte de La Libertad, cuando la franja urbana se diluye mientras más se acerca a México, y deja paso a las reservas. Allá se encuentra El Naranjo, un pueblo fronterizo al que, echando mano de un desfasado estereotipo, los mismos militares llaman la Tijuana guatemalteca: trasiego de drogas y otras mercancías, trata, migración indocumentada.  Cuando conversamos la primera vez, lo hicimos en el cuartel general de Cobán, la cabecera departamental de Alta Verapaz. Él vestía uniforme y hablaba con desenvolvimiento de Los Zetas y de las familias locales vinculadas al narcotráfico. Ahora, de civil y en su día libre, es más mesurado para referirse a Petén. Hay que arrancarle los dobles sentidos a algunas de sus respuestas.  El coronel conoce bien la zona donde ocurrió el último desalojo de 300 campesinos. Estuvo de hecho en ese operativo. Recalca una y otra vez que cumplían órdenes del Ministerio Público, que fueron a sacar a gente asentada en zona prohibida, que encontraron gente humilde: mujeres, muchas mujeres ancianas, y niños. Dice que a él nunca le dijeron nada acerca de narcotraficantes.  Le hago ver que tanto el ministro de Gobernación como el mismo comunicado oficial del gobierno dijeron que se trataba de personas vinculadas al narco. Sin matices. “Áreas en poder del narcotráfico”, calificaron ese asentamiento campesino. El coronel se reserva su opinión. De cualquier modo, es un despropósito seguir preguntando por el tema. Es absurdo, el gobierno mismo se contradice. Desalojar a unos narcotraficantes por usurpar un área natural protegida sería como arrestar a un asesino por robar el teléfono a quien acaba de matar.  El coronel medita un instante, sorbe té, aclara que no va a opinar sobre la postura de Menocal, que él puede dar su opinión. Lo interrumpo y le pregunto si cuando acompañó el desalojo en La Libertad creyó que estaba sacando narcotraficantes.  —No. Pienso que no se puede descartar que más de algún campesino esté involucrado, pero no se puede generalizar. Muchos se ven forzados a buscar las áreas protegidas. Venden sus terrenos para que sean tomados por la gente que cultiva palma africana… ¿Y para dónde agarran? La única zona que queda para cultivar es el área protegida.  —Usted conoce la zona, coronel. Se dice que hay extensiones enormes de tierra que pertenecen de facto a los Mendoza, a los Lorenzana, a veces a través de testaferros.  —La gente señala unas extensiones de terreno como de una familia, de otra familia, pero a ciencia cierta no se puede saber porque no hay nadie que alegue el registro.  —¿Usted cree que hay gente realmente poderosa que tiene tierras en áreas protegidas?  —Pienso que sí.  —¿Grupos que las ocupan para trasiego de drogas, maderas y contrabando…?  —Pienso que sí.  Existe un informe con datos gubernamentales que habla de que algunos de estos terrenos están registrados legalmente. Incluso algunos altos mandos militares como el general Eduardo Morales, que coordinó la instalación este año del estado de sitio en Petén, consideran que la zona norte del departamento, repleta de áreas protegidas como Laguna del Tigre, está atestada de grandes extensiones de los capos que coordinan aterrizajes constantes de avionetas que luego queman, para no dejar pistas. Morales incluso me habló hace unos días de depredación descarada de la naturaleza para construir pistas y cementerios de avionetas. Me habló de un hotel con capacidad para 100 personas en Sierra del Lacandón, y de un aterrizaje reciente en Laguna del Tigre donde un oficial y dos soldados se enfrentaron a unos 40 hombres armados que los obligaron a huir. “Es triste reconocerlo –dijo–, pero es así”.  Le digo al coronel Díaz Santos que me parece muy raro que el Consejo Nacional de Áreas Protegidas (Conap) no se entere de esto, pero sí de los asentamientos campesinos; que la Policía, que apoya en la vigilancia al Conap, tampoco se entere. Le pregunto si él confía en esas autoridades.  —¡Uf! Me reservo la respuesta.  —Coronel, y ya que hablamos del Informe que ha estado dando vueltas en todo Petén, ¿usted le da credibilidad?  —Le voy a contestar con el comentario que me hizo un amigo. Para lo que sirve el Informe es para ser cauto de lo que uno tiene que hablar y de con quién tiene que hablar.  El Informe se titula “Grupos de poder en Petén: territorio, política y negocios”, salió a luz pública en julio de este año y fue financiado por el organismo internacional Soros Foundation. Un resumen fue publicado por el portal Insight Crime, consultado por la cúpula política de Washington. A escala nacional, fue retomado por medios guatemaltecos como El Periódico y Plaza Pública. En Petén ningún medio local se hizo eco, pero no hubo una persona, fuera activista, funcionario o militar, con la que conversara durante mi viaje, que no lo hubiera leído. Ha circulado de mano en mano, de boca en boca, de e-mail en e-mail.  Los autores, investigadores de diferentes países, de diferentes especialidades, no firmaron el Informe. Es anónimo. Ellos no han dado declaraciones en ningún medio. Temen por sus vidas y no quieren que nadie sepa ni siquiera de qué nacionalidad son o en qué país viven. Luego de varios intermediarios, conseguí que dos de ellos accedieran a conversar vía skype. El Informe es muy explícito, rico en fuentes oficiales. Toda su información sobre propiedades está sustentada con datos del catastro; el resto, con datos oficiales, informes internacionales, declaraciones de funcionarios publicadas en medios de comunicación y entrevistas con informantes claves en Petén.  En las conversaciones vía skype me dijeron que no publicaron sus nombres porque los poderosos de los que hablan tienen influencias incluso a nivel internacional. Me aseguraron que fueron recatados. “Publicamos solo lo que pudimos comprobar, aunque hay muchas propiedades no registradas en áreas protegidas que de facto pertenecen a grupos del crimen organizado”, explicó uno.  El Informe no deja títere con cabeza. Petén aparece dibujado como tierra fértil para la corrupción política, el trasiego de drogas y la concentración de tierras y poder en muy pocas manos. Petén no es tierra para gente humilde.  En la evaluación que se hace de los partidos políticos, las conclusiones son escandalosas: a las candidaturas ganadoras para alcaldías o diputaciones distritales solo se llega si se tienen nexos políticos con el crimen organizado o si directamente se forma parte de alguna estructura criminal. El Informe señala con nombres y apellidos personas en todos los partidos, sin excepción, que serían las encargadas de realizar esas alianzas.  Las acusaciones llegan hasta el más alto nivel. Sobre el candidato presidencial del partido Líder, Manuel Baldizón, quien es originario de Petén, se dice que su familia consiguió su poder económico en gran parte gracias al contrabando de piezas arqueológicas. El Informe remite a testimonios anónimos de las personas que participaron en grupos de saqueo de ruinas mayas: extraían piezas para luego venderlas a coleccionistas extranjeros.  El Informe también explica cómo familias que desde hace décadas se dedican al crimen organizado, como los Mendoza, originarios del estratégico departamento de Izabal, fronterizo con Honduras y Belice, se han apropiado de enormes fincas en Petén desde hace mucho tiempo. Los Mendoza poseen 23 fincas dispersas en cuatro municipios peteneros. La extensión de esas fincas suma 660 caballerías. Muchas de las propiedades están en las riberas del río La Pasión, y al menos una de ellas tiene una mansión con piscina y pista de aterrizaje.  Ninguna autoridad desaloja o señala en voz alta a estos terratenientes. El Informe explica que la mayor extensión de tierras, 250 caballerías que los Mendoza poseen a su nombre y a nombre de testaferros, se encuentra en gran parte dentro de la reserva Sierra del Lacandón, el parque nacional del que fueron corridos los 300 campesinos del último desalojo, muchos de los que, sin otro lugar al que ir, se retiraron a la selva del lado mexicano. Tanto el coronel como el general apuntan a que no se trata solo de que en esas zonas las familias del crimen organizado invaden terrenos que no les pertenecen, sino que en sus rutinas mafiosas se apropian para establecer sus cinturones de tenencia de tierra que les permitan hacer sus trasiegos. Incluso el general Morales asegura que Los Zetas tienen bases de entrenamiento y descanso en Laguna del Tigre.  No se trata de actividades discretas. El general Morales recuerda cómo hace unos tres años encontraron en la ribera del río San Pedro, entre Laguna del Tigre y Sierra del Lacandón, bodegas enormes de almacenaje e incluso un barco en construcción. “Un barco grande, como para llevar carros. Uno de los fiscales dijo que parecía el Arca de Noé”, recuerda el general.  Esas fincas tienen conexión entre sí hasta llegar a la frontera natural con México, el río Usumacinta. “En cada una de las fincas –dice una de las personas entrevistadas para el Informe– tienen grupos armados”.  Petén se ha convertido en una especie de condominio de las grandes familias del crimen organizado de Guatemala. Entre los apellidos que el propio presidente Colom ha relacionado con el narcotráfico, Mendoza no es el único con fuerte presencia en el departamento. Los León, originarios de Zacapa -también frontera con Honduras-, tienen en Petén 316 caballerías; “en puntos estratégicos de las rutas de la droga”, explicita el Informe. Los Lorenzana, también de Zacapa, tenían incluso cuatro fincas en el área protegida de Laguna del Tigre. Una de las fincas, en un sinsentido del sistema, estaba inscrita en el Registro de Propiedad a nombre del patriarca Waldemar Lorenzana, extraditado este año a Estados Unidos bajo cargos de narcotráfico.  El Informe concluye que las propiedades relacionadas con los grupos criminales alcanzan una cifra de cuatro dígitos: 1 mil 179 caballerías. O sea, siete veces la superficie de la ciudad de San Salvador. Las empresas de palma africana tienen en registro oficial 1 mil 27 caballerías. Eso significa que al menos 10.5% de la tierra que el Estado cataloga como cultivable en Petén está fuera del alcance de un campesino común, así tuviera el dinero para comprar.  A cambio de eso, y según el Conap, para el año 2007, solo en el municipio de Sayaxché, casi 8 mil personas habían sido desplazadas de 902 caballerías. Eso eran 27 comunidades campesinas que dieron paso a las empresas de palma africana o a otros compradores. Lo que nadie dice es que los campesinos, que muchas veces se quedan sin opción cuando los narcos quieren sus tierras, también deben bregar con la insistencia de compra de las empresas transnacionales, que en ocasiones presionan para conseguir lo que quieren: más tierra.  Susurros en quekchí  Son las 6 de la mañana, y los rayos del sol son débiles, reconfortantes. Voy en un autobús que de El Subín, cerca de Sayaxché, trepa hacia el norte petenero, hacia Santa Elena. El vehículo no va lleno, y en la parte de atrás solo viajan dos personas más. Uno, según entiendo, es campesino, y hace preguntas al otro, que es obrero de la construcción. Van delante de mí y resulta obvio que no les importa ser escuchados.  El campesino pregunta al obrero si hay trabajo en su rama. El obrero le dice que sí, que en la zona de Santa Elena se están levantando buenas construcciones. El campesino le contesta que tiene suerte, que no son tiempos de trabajar la tierra, que “si vos tenés una buena tierra, te la quitan”, que ya solo van quedando “tierras secas, muertas”. Le dice también que allá abajo, por Sayaxché, solo queda trabajar para las empresas de palma africana, porque “los señores que tienen tierras buenas no quieren trabajadores para trabajar la tierra”.  Ya en Santa Elena me recibe Alfredo Che, un campesino recio, compacto, con ese castellano cortado y lento de los quekchí. Él es de la directiva de la Asociación de Comunidades Campesinas Indígenas para el Desarrollo Integral de Petén, que a su vez forma parte de la Coordinadora Nacional de Organizaciones Campesinas. Su red de contactos es enorme, y una de sus principales reivindicaciones es que se negocie con las comunidades que han sido desalojadas de reservas naturales. Piden que, a falta de opción para conseguir otras zonas para cultivar, se les permita regresar condicionados a no expandirse y a cultivar bajo normas que respeten el ecosistema.  Che habla con rabia, se le nota en el gesto, pero la voz nunca deja de ser un susurro. Se queja de que en Petén hasta los asesinatos de campesinos son un argumento contra los campesinos. En mayo de 2011, en una finca llamada Los Cocos, en la zona despoblada de La Libertad, hubo una sonora masacre de 27 personas. Según las autoridades, fue perpetrada por Los Zetas. También dijeron que el ataque iba dirigido contra el dueño de la finca, pero que como no lo encontraron, se desquitaron con los campesinos. A algunos los decapitaron con motosierras. En unas fotografías que me mostró un investigador que estuvo en la escena aparecen cadáveres con las botas de trabajo puestas.  Incluso el Ministerio de Gobernación aseguró que los cadáveres eran de campesinos que realizaban labores agrícolas en la finca, pero Che dice que las autoridades peteneras se agarran a casos como este para argumentar en las negociaciones con su organización que los campesinos colaboran con las “narcofincas” y que por eso los matan. Para Che, aun si eso fuera cierto, los desalojos siguen aplicándose siempre a los mismos, a los que se parecen a Venustiano.  —Es que no desalojan a los finqueros, sino a los campesinos que están fuera de las fincas, a las comunidades que cultivan lo que se comen. Le dirán que es verde por ahí, pero lo real es que al caminar el parque Sierra del Lacandón, la Biosfera Maya, ya no se ven montañas vírgenes. La Conap tiene guardas, pero no pueden hacer nada, andan una pistolita .38, y la Unidad de Protección de la Naturaleza... Dos policías más tres guardas no pueden enfrentarse con un grupo armado con armas de asalto. A lo mejor los mira y les dice adiós. Están atacando a las comunidades indefensas, pero a los finqueros no les hacen nada.  No son solo voces de la sociedad civil las que denuncian estas contradicciones entre poderosos y humildes. Francisco Dall’Anesse, el fiscal al mando de la Comisión Internacional Contrala Impunidad en Guatemala (CICIG) instalada por Naciones Unidas en 2006, dedicó unas palabras a este desbalance durante un discurso que pronunció el 4 de septiembre en un encuentro de periodistas en Argentina. Dijo que en Petén “hay grupos de indígenas tirados a la calle de sus terrenos”, mientras que contra los verdaderos narcos nadie hace nada, y contó la anécdota de cómo cuando un alto comisionado de Naciones Unidas iba hacia el rancho Los Cocos a presenciar la escena del descuartizamiento de los 27 campesinos, lo pararon narcos armados hasta los dientes para preguntarle hacia dónde iba, y lo obligaron a identificarse para dejarlo en paz.  Che asegura que, ya sea bajo amenaza de los narcos o por presiones de las empresas de palma africana, por una caballería que puede valer 200 mil quetzales (25 mil 500 dólares) se reciben con suerte 50 mil. Le pregunto por qué no denuncian. Contesta que ya lo han hecho muchas veces, pero el resultado es un trámite burocrático que termina engavetado en alguna delegación del Ministerio Público en el mejor de los casos.  Le pregunto por esa otra modalidad de sacar a los campesinos de su tierra, la que ocupan las empresas, y me dice que hay coyotes, que es como llaman por estos lados a los negociadores contratados por las empresas, gente de las mismas comunidades muchas veces. Los envían para insistir a los campesinos, una y otra vez, hasta que ceden y firman contratos que no comprenden. Me dice que lo mejor es que para entender eso hable con otro miembro de su asociación, con Domingo Choc, quien se encarga del municipio más codiciado por las transnacionales de palma africana, Sayaxché.  Por la tarde aparece Choc. Las empresas son inteligentes, dice, saben meter miedo en las comunidades.  La amenaza consiste en presionar y dividir. “Si un coyote no lo logra enviarán a otro más pilas, hasta que lo consiga”, explica. Insisten una y otra vez hasta que dividen a la comunidad y se quedan con los últimos a los que amenazan con dejarlos encerrados dentro de la parcela de palma africana. Y una vez ocurre eso, los guardias privados no permiten que esos campesinos que se quedan encerrados entre palma africana pasen por las tierras de la empresa, no dejan que metan vehículos para sacar sus sacos de maíz, de frijol y venderlos en la calle. Los condenan a cosechar para comer y nada más. Así van logrando que esos mismos renuentes vendan y se conviertan en trabajadores de la finca a los que suelen mantener sin contrato, por jornal, o sea, a los que les pagan menos de los 63.70 quetzales diarios (ocho dólares) por día de trabajo que la ley estipula como salario mínimo. Y así hasta que los campesinos se hartan de sudar por una miseria la tierra que antes era de ellos, y se largan como Venustiano a una zona protegida, esperando no ser desalojados y exponiéndose a ser acusados de narcotraficantes.  A José Cacxoj, un campesino de Sayaxché que conocí en este viaje, le ocurrió eso. A sus 63 años se hartó de recibir cada día la visita de un tal ingeniero Gustavo que le invitaba a vender su parcela en la aldea Las Camelias antes de quedarse encerrado entre palma africana. Vendió por 100 mil quetzales su parcela que no llegaba ni a la mitad de una caballería. Hace dos años que busca una parcela en otras tierras del departamento que no le interesen a los narcos ni a las empresas de palma, pero no la encuentra, porque la manzana cuesta el doble de lo que a él le pagaron. Así que Cacxoj está dilapidando su dinero alquilando parcelas bajo el trato de que de lo que cultive tiene que dar la mitad al propietario. Si una de las dos cosechas anuales se cae, como le sucedió el año pasado que llovió poco, Cacxoj se arruina. Ahora anda pensando en ocupar lo poco que le queda para largarse a invadir tierras protegidas, para convertirse en un invasor, como llaman el Estado y los grupos de poder a esos campesinos, para convertirse en narcotraficantes, como llamaron a Venustiano y a su comunidad.  Pregunto a Choc qué tan extensa es la lista de comunidades desalojadas. Me contesta que no sabe decirme en número de personas, sino en comunidades con nombres y familias.  —Está la comunidad El Progreso, en Sayaxché; se terminó, 23 familias. La comunidad El Cubil, 32 familias, terminada, ya no existe. El Canaleño, 46 familias. La Torre, mi comunidad, 76 familias. Santa Rosa, 86 familias. Arroyo Santa María, 43 familias…Y la que todos recuerdan como la primera comunidad, Centro Uno, 164 familias, terminada, ya no existe.  Venustiano y Centro Uno  Ha pasado un día desde que me junté con Che y Choc. Ellos fueron quienes me ayudaron a contactar a campesinos de Centro Uno. Es un mediodía ardiente y húmedo. El autobús que va hacia La Libertad, donde nos encontraremos, lleva las ventanas abiertas, cruza por varios tramos estropeados de la carretera donde el polvo se instala en la piel sudada y parece atraer nubes de minúsculos mosquitos que revolotean en la cara.  El centro del municipio es un mercado callejero. Los tuc tuc se mueven con rapidez entre la gente y sorprendentemente no atropellan a ningún peatón. Cada negocio tiene un altavoz con música norteña o un megáfono desde el que un dependiente grita las promociones. Entro en una pollería, y desde el traspatio donde lavan los trastos en una pila, llamo a Venustiano, que me dice que ubica el lugar, que espere ahí mismo, que llegará con Santos, otro ex habitante de Centro Uno.  Venustiano, a sus 56 años, es un campesino prototipo. Fibroso, de bigote, con una raída camiseta blanca, un jeans y botas negras de trabajo. Con esa piel en el rostro que, en miniatura, tiene grietas como las de la tierra del campo que seca después de la lluvia. Lo acompaña Santos, un recio y lampiño indígena quekchí.  Ambos hablan con un tono a medio camino entre la pena y el agradecimiento. Parece que no están acostumbrados a contar su historia. Cuando ocurrió el desalojo de Centro Uno en 2009, los medios solo recogieron la versión oficial. Dice Venustiano que a él nunca nadie le preguntó nada. Venustiano habla sobre un lugar infértil, de plásticos, maderos y champas, de la economía de la miseria, de días en que trabaja ocho horas en parcelas ajenas, lejos de su improvisada casa, de ganar 30 quetzales por jornada, de que “al sembrar en lo ajeno ni la semilla pepena”. Lo interrumpo para pedirle que empiece por el principio, que me cuente cómo era Centro Uno allá en Sierra del Lacandón. “¿Cómo era?”, pregunta, deja el pollo asado que comemos sobre el plato, se limpia la grasa del bigote y espanta el nubarrón de mosquitos de su cara con un manotazo lento. Hace una pausa y pone los ojos del que recuerda, tornados hacia la nada.  —Donde vivíamos teníamos agua, un arroyo, tierra. El arroyo era limpio, se miraban bien los pies. Había una vaquería donde uno se enlodaba para entrar, pero al pasarla, aquello era lindo, había maíz, frijol y éramos felices. Había palos de coco, de aguacate, palos cargadores todos, naranjas, limón, mango cargador, así, ve –estira la mano semiabierta hacia arriba–. Uno conoce sus tierras. Caña también, yuca, y guineo, macal, o malanga que le llaman, uno se sentía feliz de la vida.  A las 10 de la mañana del 16 de junio de 2009, un contingente de unos 600 militares, policías, guardias forestales, autoridades del Ministerio Público y funcionarios de la Procuraduríade para la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos (PDDH) inauguraron con la comunidad Centro Uno una modalidad de desalojos masivos de campesinos en Petén. 164 familias fueron removidas de la comunidad que, por unos pocos, y sin permiso, había sido creada antes de que se firmara la paz en 1996. Unos llegaron antes, allá por 1992. El grueso, familiares de los pioneros, llegó en los siguientes cinco años, casi todos campesinos de Ixcán, Izabal, Quiché y Cobán que habían deambulado buscando dónde instalarse para cultivar la tierra lejos de la guerra.  Centro Uno nunca fue un secreto. Había dos escuelas construidas por los propios campesinos donde 180 niños recibían clases de cinco maestros de la comunidad que habían sido capacitados por el gobierno. Tienen cartas, algunas de la década del 90, donde solicitan a las autoridades nacionales y estatales audiencia para discutir la legalización de Centro Uno, como lo lograron unas pocas comunidades que se instalaron en el parque antes de la declaratoria de área protegida en 1990. Los de Centro Uno reunieron cartas oficiales de cinco alcaldes auxiliares de caseríos aledaños que dan fe de que los fundadores de Centro Uno, aun antes de nombrar la comunidad, vivían ahí mismo desde 1988.  —En fin –continúa Venustiano–, aquel día de 2009 nos dieron media hora para desalojar. Yo logré agarrar a mis cuatro niños. Dejé una prensa de maíz del ancho de dos metros cuadrados. Ya lo tenía en mi casa, y también 10 manzanas de pepitoria listas para cosechar. Todo el mundo perdió todo.  Estuardo Puga, el auxiliar de la PDDH a cargo de Petén que estuvo ahí, me confirmó que ese fue el tiempo que les dieron para desalojar, y que en camiones sacaron a las familias y las dejaron en Retalteco, un caserío a las afueras de La Libertad. Dijo que ellos se fueron a la 1:30 de la tarde, cuando terminó la diligencia, pero que se quedaron los militares y funcionarios del Conap. Dijo también que luego hubo denuncias de saqueo. Venustiano dice que se lo llevaron todo en unos camiones, que pasaron frente a ellos en Retalteco con sus novillos, sus sacos de cultivo, sus plantas eléctricas.  —Nos sacaron con el decir que nosotros somos narcotraficantes. Yo lo que veo es que es una excusa para las autoridades actuales, como para taparle el ojo al macho –dice Venustiano.  Le pregunto si alguien en la comunidad participaba en alguna actividad del narcotráfico.  —El narcotraficante vive en mansiones, no tiene necesidad de vivir en casitas de palma como vivíamos allá, y mucho menos en champas de nylon como vivimos ahora… ¿Quiere ver dónde vivimos los narcotraficantes de Centro Uno?  Tomamos un tuc tuc que nos saca del bullicio del mercado. Nos deja en una vereda de tierra por la que caminamos durante unos 15 minutos hasta llegar a una parcela.  —Entonces, ¿aquí es donde viven ustedes, los narcotraficantes?  —Aquí mismo, mire usté. Venga, le voy a presentar a toda la gente –me dice Venustiano.  Retira el alambre del palo y deja caer la portezuela. 236\n",

      "UNDP, Government of Haiti provide immediate support to flood-affected victims  Flood-affected areas in the northern city of Cap-Haitien and other neighbouring towns following heavy rains. Photo Credit: MINUSTAH  Port-au-Prince - Haiti’s Department of Civil Protection in partnership with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has been working non-stop to assist flood-affected families in the northern city of Cap-Haitien and other neighbouring towns following heavy rains, floods and landslides that killed 17 people, five of them children. More than 15,000 houses were flooded, 90 were destroyed and 800 were severely damaged. Over 6,500 people are temporarily housed in emergency shelters.  The recent floods have also affected over 2,200 hectares of crops in one of the country’s most fertile areas.  “This hurricane season is nearly over and has been relatively mild in Haiti, but the recent storms have once again showed the country’s vulnerability to natural disasters,” said UNDP Haiti Senior Country Director Sophie de Caen, adding that UNDP and the UN family have been immediately working with the Government to mobilize resources and provide support to the most affected populations.  ”However, these floods actually showed that Haiti is strengthening its disaster prevention capacity: as a result of UNDP’s work to improve Haiti’s Civil Protection Department and its effectiveness, the response to the recent floods was entirely led by national authorities.”  Moreover, around 40 UNDP experts work directly with the Government and its Emergency Operation Centers at the national and local levels.  To mitigate the impact of floods and other natural disasters, UNDP and the Haitian Government have also planted close to nine million trees and worked with farmers to plant more resistant crops that prevent erosion. In addition, flood mitigation measures have been improved, using watershed management tools and protecting riverbanks.  “It is clear that the Government’s recent efforts with its partners—including UNDP—to boost resilience, particularly in the north and northeastern areas, are a step in the right direction,” de Caen said. 238\n",

      "Local authorities say that Nicaragua and Honduras have experienced heavy rainfall during the first two weeks of June, causing floods which have left a total of 8 people dead and 2 missing.  Nicaragua  In Nicaragua, the disaster management agency, Sistema Nacional para la Prevención, Mitigación y Atención de Desastres (SINAPRED), say that heavy rain between 02 and 14 June has left 6 people dead, and affected 35,350 in 7,041 households. As of 15 June, there were 129 families displaced by the floods and severe weather, most of them in Managua municipality. The families are currently being housed in shelters or temporary accommodation.  The heavy rain and ensuing floods have affected 11 departments of the country – Managua, Madriz, Carazo, Nueva Segovia, León, Matagalpa, Masaya, Chinandega, Esteli, Granada and the North Caribbean Coast Region.  According to SINAPRED figures, 6,975 homes have been flooded over the last 2 weeks, with at least 22 homes have been completely destroyed, and a further 44 severely damaged. Two schools have been destroyed in the floods, with 10 other schools damaged.  Landslide Warnings  On Monday 15 June, the heavy rain prompted SINAPRED to issue landslide warnings for those living in communities near the volcanoes in the country.  Dr. Guillermo Gonzalez, Co Director SINAPRED, said that the slopes of active volcanoes, including San Cristobal, Telica Momotombo and Concepción, as well as inactive volcanoes such as Casitas, Santa Clara, Mombacho and Maderas, have been made unstable by the heavy rains, increasing the possibility of sudden landslides which could cause damage to crops and infrastructure and the loss of human lives.  Given that such landslides can occur suddenly, Dr. Gonzalez said that it is very difficult to give effective early warnings. He recommended those in vulnerable areas refer to hazard maps produced by Instituto Nicaragüense de Estudios Territoriales (INETER) to assess the conditions of the communities most at risk.  Honduras  Local media in Honduras are reporting that the country has also been badly affected by heavy rain and resulting floods over the last few days.  As of 15 June 2015, at least two people have died and another two are missing, over 500 have been affected and over 115 homes have been damaged. Over 100 people have been displaced by floods in the last few days, most of them in Siguatepeque but also some in Tegucigalpa. 241\n",
      "Más de 200 familias han sido evacuadas en el Valle de Sula, debido a las inundaciones provocadas por el desbordamiento del río Ulúa.  Autoridades de la Comisión Permanente de Contingencias (Copeco) se mantienen monitoreando el clima constantemente, debido a las lluvias que han caído en gran parte del territorio nacional, especialmente en la zona occidental.  Hasta ayer, Copeco manejaba que se había albergado a unas 277 familias en los municipios de Pimienta, San Manuel, Potrerillos y Villanueva, en el departamento de Cortés, así como en Santa Bárbara.  Las casas de estas personas se vieron afectadas por las llenas.  El titular nacional de Copeco, Moisés Alvarado, manifestó que los trabajos de monitoreo son constantes, pues se espera que las lluvias continúen para las próximas horas.  “Desde el pasado viernes se ha estado monitoreando la crecida del río Ulúa, pues las lluvias en el occidente no habían parado y eso provoca que el nivel aumente, pero afortunadamente ha disminuido el caudal”, recalcó Alvarado.  SIGUE ALERTA ROJA  Detalló que la Alerta Roja para el Valle de Sula se mantiene, pues depende de cómo vayan disminuyendo las lluvias.  “La Alerta Roja estaba para 72 horas (desde el sábado hasta hoy), pero esperamos que cambie o se mantenga, porque se esperan más lluvias, aunque con poco acumulados para el Valle de Sula”, dijo.  Ayer por la tarde, varios equipos de Copeco se desplazaron por diferentes albergues en Pimienta, Potrerillos y Villanueva, donde entregaron a los damnificados raciones de comida, kits de higiene, frazadas y duchas portátiles, entre otros implementos.  “Hasta el momento son 277 familias albergadas las que hay, aunque algunas permanecen en las casas de parientes, pero también se les está brindando apoyo por parte de la Copeco, pues se les llevó raciones de alimento, kits de higiene y otros implementos, con apoyo de la Cruz Roja”.  FAMILIA ATRAPADA      Por su parte, el subjefe noroccidental de Copeco, Rony Rodríguez, manifestó que en las colonias Policarpo Paz García, La Democracia y la Centroamericana de El Progreso, Yoro, también se reportaron inundaciones debido a las filtraciones en los bordos, por el alto nivel del río Ulúa.  “Hasta el momento, en estas colonias no se ha evacuado a ninguna familia, pero se está monitoreando que el nivel del río no aumente, porque se inundan con las filtraciones por los bordos de contención”, explicó Rodríguez.  Detalló que en San Manuel fueron evacuadas siete personas que residen en el alivio del río, por lo que reiteradamente están siendo rescatadas.  “Estas personas, hace siete días permanecieron albergadas; se hablará con el alcalde para tratar de buscar una solución, porque están en peligro sus vidas”.  Mientras que en Tencoa, Santa Bárbara, la crecida del río provocó inundaciones, por lo que una familia quedó atrapada en un islote, ya que al momento que el caudal se desbordaba, iban pasando por una calle.  “El Cuerpo de Bomberos rescató a una familia conformada por tres personas (la pareja y un bebé de 18 meses de nacido), pues quedó en un islote, al momento que el cauce se desbordó. De igual manera, se han dado pequeños derrumbes que no han causado daños mayores”, refirió.     242\n",

      "3.6 million people affected. Over 45,000 houses damaged. Poorest are the worst hit.  North, central and coastal districts of Odisha are facing massive floods since August 5, 2014 due to the rise in the waters of the rivers Mahanadi, Baitarani, Budhabalanga, Subarnarekha and their tributaries. Release of excess water from dams in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh and incessant rains worsened the situation.  Worst hit:  Jajpur, Puri, Bhadhrak, Kendrapara and Cuttack.  Evacuations:  Government deployed 11 battalions of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and 30 battalions of Odisha State Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF). Rescue operations were completed on August 9, 2014.  Oxfam’s team carried out a rapid assessment in the worst affected Jajpur and Puri districts, where most of the villages are still submerged 15 ft deep, 8 out of 10 blocks in Jajpur and 6 out of 11 blocks in Puri district are still cut off and can be reached only via boats.  709,841 people displaced in Jajpur and 363,832 in Puri district.  Over 366,541 hectares of farm land is under water and the paddy crop has been destroyed.  Over 45,953 houses are damaged and will need reconstruction.  The floods have impacted 1.13 million livestock.  Families took shelter in school buildings, Panchayat Ghar (village meeting halls) and on higher grounds. Many are living on embankments in make shift shelters with their families and livestock. The food and financial security of the agrarian community has been impacted for a long term. With inadequate availability of drinking water supply, poor sanitation facilities and risky hygiene practices, there are high chances of worsening of water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) situation in the affected areas.  Disease:  Due to the lack of immediate healthcare, cases of diarrhea, fever, common cold, fungal infections are now being reported. There are many 0-5 year old children, lactating and pregnant women who need immediate medical attention.  Food security and nutrition:  Many from displaced communities are landless daily wage labourers with no work available at the moment. The Scheduled Caste (SC) communities in the affected villages are worst hit and have no access to food, livelihood, shelter and WaSH. They are relying 100% on government relief for food.  Poor Living Conditions:  Temporary shelters close to each other, people share this space on the embankment with their livestock. Some are living on road sides, high lands and on roof tops of concrete houses almost marooned in the flood waters. They are living in shelters made wood frames and tarpaulin.  Water and Sanitation:  The flood water has contaminated the tube wells, ponds and other water sources.  Schools:  Education of children from primary school is disrupted the buildings have been converted to a temporary relief shelter in Jajpur district. In Puri, school buildings are still submerged in flood water  Government Relief:  Food aid was available for ten days when 243 free community kitchens fed over 86,330 populations with cooked food. State government mobilized 77,856 quintals of rice, 5,221 quintals of flattened rice, 404 quintals of jiggery and 1,606 polythene rolls as emergency relief. Frontline health workers were mobilised by the health department to provide water disinfecting halogen tablets, ORS packets, anti-fungal and anti-diarrheal drugs. A government survey of damage of shelter and crop is yet to start.  Map of Assessed Areas      Dasarathpur block of Jajpur district was caught unawares, as this area is protected from flooding by the embankment. The people were not prepared for the flood, the first in 50 years, and therefore do not have sufficient coping mechanisms. Many have been displaced and are now housed in emergency shelters at schools and GP Offices. Many schools are non functional as many of them are being used as shelters while some are still submerged.  Dasratpur Block residents evacuated their villages and moved to embankments along with their livestock. All low-lying areas and crop fields of the assessed villages were submerged under water. Only means of access available to Rapid Assessment team were boats provided by the administration and NGOs. But the frequency of availability of boats within the villages is low, limiting the mobility of the community to access basic amenities at block level. The block administration has provided only one boat in Kanas block of Puri district and 21 boats in Jajpur district.  Most of the households do not have food grains and are dependent on relief received from government, which is minimal. A few local community leaders are providing some food aid. In few villages, local community based organisations are also supporting those affected with cooked food. 246\n",

      "Villagers with their belongings sit in a relief camp after their evacuation at Supaul district in Bihar August 3, 2014. REUTERS/Krishna Murari Kishan  BHUBANESHWAR(Thomson Reuters Foundation) - About 30,000 evacuated villagers in Bihar began returning home on Tuesday after the threat of floods due to a landslide in neighbouring Nepal eased, but 100,000 remained in relief camps, government officials said.  The landslide, triggered by heavy rains in Nepal's Sindhupalchowk district on Saturday, killed at least 33 people and created a mud dam blocking the Sunkoshi river, which flows into India as the Kosi river.  Indian authorities, fearing a torrent of water as the Nepalese army tried to clear the landslide, evacuated more than 130,000 villagers in Bihar over the weekend.  A senior disaster management official said the careful clearing of the landslide across the border had lessened the risk of flash floods and 30,000 evacuees were told to return home.  \"Some of the districts … in the downstream area such as Darbhanga, Madhubani, Khagaria and Bhagalpur, they may not face the problems anticipated earlier,\" said Vyasji, principal secretary of Bihar disaster management department.  \"We have stopped our evacuation process in these four districts. People who are at the relief camps have been told to go back to their villages,\" he told Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Patna, Bihar's main city.  But the districts of Supaul, Saharsa and Madhepura remained on high alert, Vyasji added, and around 100,000 people were still sheltering in relief camps.  Both India and Nepal have monitored the Kosi river closely since it broke its banks in 2008 and changed its course, killing more than 500 people, submerging swathes of land and affecting more than two million people in Bihar.  The Nepalese army has set off a series of controlled blasts over the past three days to drain the artificial lake slowly. Yadav Koirala, chief of the Natural Disaster Relief Division at the home ministry, said the army was trying to increase the river’s flow by draining the artificial lake formed by the landslide.  \"The army set off a small controlled explosion at the mud dam today to drain the lake. It is not a big blast,\" Koirala told Thomson Reuters Foundation. \"We are doing it very carefully so the water does not flow suddenly.  Monsoon rains that start in mid-June and continue through September are crucial for many countries in South Asia, but scores of people die every year in landslides and floods.  Heavy rains in June last year caused rivers and lakes to burst their banks, killing almost 6,000 people in the Indian state of Uttarakhand.

      "October 2014  Heavy and intense monsoon rain has devastated vulnerable communities across India as well as areas of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. We are asking for your help to provide urgent humanitarian support.  Homes swept away  At least 280 people died and around five million people were affected, following recent incessant rain in Jammu and Kashmir in northern India.  Raging floodwaters destroyed homes, sunk entire villages and deluged Srinagar city. More than 80% of areas in the city were underwater.  Our local partner Church Auxliary for Social Action (CASA) and Act Now for Harmony and Democracy (ANHAD) is responding now meeting the immediate needs for shelter, medical supplies and safe drinking water.  Our Regional Emergency Manager, Dipankar Patnaik said: ‘With winter fast approaching, this is an anxious time. It will soon be bitterly cold at night. Families have lost clothing and bedding. If people’s homes haven’t been totally destroyed, they are finding that they are simply too damaged or damp to live in. As ever, it’s the poorest and most marginalised who are hardest hit.’  Our partners have already distributed 4,000 blankets, 1,500 solar lanterns and 250 pressure cookers. With your support we could reach more of the worst affected.  Alongside providing vital food relief, our partners are ensuring clean drinking water by filtering polluted water sources and distributing water purification tablets.  ‘ Flooding on this scale is devastating. Communities in affected areas rely on farming to earn a living and feed themselves. For many that’s all gone. It’s an anxious and uncertain time.'  Thousands of desperate families  Food distribution in Odisha state run by our partner CASA  Since last July, torrential rain has caused severe flooding and affected 3.6 million people in Odisha state, eastern India.  Though water is abundant, it is dangerous to drink. CASA is providing community kitchens, filtering water from open wells and distributing vital water purification tablets.  We will be meeting the desperate need for shelter aiming to reach 650 households with tarpaulins, ground sheets and mosquito nets.  We also aim to support 500 households with cash-for-work, a much needed source of income in the aftermath of an emergency.  Serving the community  Our Regional Emergency Manager, Dipankar Patnaik said: ‘Flooding on this scale is devastating. Communities in affected areas rely on farming to earn a living and feed themselves. For many that’s all gone. It’s an anxious and uncertain time.  ‘In an effort to make ends meet, households are often forced to sell whatever might be left of their belongings and slide deeper into debt. With no savings to fall back on, cash-for-work is vital.’  Those involved help clear debris and repair people’s homes. It provides a much needed income for the most vulnerable while serving the community.  Homeless villagers in Uttar Pradesh  More than 1 million people were affected by flooding in Uttar Pradesh.  Around 1,100 villages were flooded, forcing families to seek refuge on nearby embankments and along the national highway.  Our partners, including Poorvanchal Gramin Vikas Sansathan (PGVS), are responding, aiming to reach 5,500 people with essential relief items including food, tarpaulins, mosquito nets, buckets and soap. 250\n"

      "VADODARA: The menacing Vishwamitri brimmed over in Vadodara, leaving several areas of the city in waist-deep water. Over 20,000 persons were evacuated to safer locations across the district due to the flash floods.While the city and district hardly received any rainfall since Tuesday night, the water released from Ajwa reservoir till early on Wednesday morning lead to flooding in Vishwamitri. The river reached a level of 34 feet in Vadodara in the morning.While the 62 gates of Ajwa reservoir were closed at 5.30am, waters in Vishwamitri refused to recede. Till 8pm, the water level was stagnant at 34 feet and was expected to recede only in the night.VMC commissioner Manish Bhardwaj said that the water level did not go down through the day as Dhadhar river into which Vishwamitri flows was also in spate. \"Dhadhar was at a level of 35.6feet and it was unable to accommodate the flow from Vishwamitri,\" said Bhardwaj. Ajwa reservoir was 213.8 feet on Wednesday night, down from Tuesday's 215.5 feet. Bhardwaj said that 15 to 20 per cent of the city was waterlogged due to the floods when Vishwamitri reached 34 feet.In Vadodara city, 12,761 were moved to safer areas while 9,528 from villages were relocated. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and EME Corps of the Indian Army also joined the rescue efforts.The city was divided into two parts with the western parts cut off from the rest of the city. Waters from the Vishwamitri river that runs through the city had inundated approaches to major bridge crossing it. A heavy traffic jam was witnessed on the newly constructed Akota-Dandia Bazaar link in the morning. But the approach of the link on the Akota side got inundated later in the day and it had to be closed. 252\n",
      "Update 26 June 2014  The overall situation appears to have improved and the number of displaced has now dropped to 8,921.  A total of 33 villages are still affected, which is down from 43 yesterday. However the flooding has now spread to affect the district of Kamrup, as well as Lakhimpur, Sonitpur, Darrang and Udalguri.  River Levels  According to India’s Central Water Commission (CWC), the Brahmaputra at Neamatighat, the Jiabharali in Sonitpur district and the Beki in Barpeta district are flowing above the danger level.  Original Report 25 June 2014  Late June nearly always means floods in Assam, India. This year is no different, and Assam officials have reported that over 25,000 people have been affected by flooding over the last 2 days. Nearly 10,000 people have been displaced. Five relief camps in Darrang and Udalguri have been set up.  The flooding is a result of the monsoon rains in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The monsoon is said to be late arriving this year, with many forecasters predicting it to bring 5% less rainfall than average. Even so, levels of the Brahmaputra river at Numaligarh and Jia Bhoreli river in Sonitpur are dangerously high. Heavy rainfall in Arunachal Pradesh – situated in the mountainous region to the north – often means problems for Assam. In particular heavy rainfall there feeds the Jia Bhoreli (Kameng) and the Dibang and Lohit rivers, which are tributaries of the Brahmaputra river.  State Disaster Management Authority officials in Assam said that 9,528 people from around 43 separate villages in Assam have already left their homes to stay in relief camps and temporary accommodation after floods struck in four districts on Monday 23 June 2014. The four districts are Lakhimpur, Sonitpur, Darrang and Udalguri. 253\n",
      "Yet another Indian state, this time Madhya Pradesh, is struggling with heavy monsoon rain and the ensuing floods. Heavy rain has been falling in the region since Monday 21 July 2014.  Odisha and its neighbouring state, Chhattisgarh, have seen at least 5 people killed in flooding incidents over the last few days.  Now it is the turn of Madhya Pradesh where floods have displaced around 2,000 people so far and have moved to one of the many temporary relief camps that have been set up. The worst affected districts in the state include Burhanpur, Harda, Balaghat and Betul. One person, believed to be a young man, was killed after he was swept away by flood water in Betul.  Around 1,000 people have been displced by floods in Burhanpur district after the Tapti river broke its banks on wednesday 23 July 2014. In Harda, several smaller rivers have overflowed, blocking roads and flooding three villages, forcing around 500 from their homes. Arond 9 villages in Balaghat have been severely affected by the floods.  Rainfall Figures – 24 Hour Period between 23 and 24 July 2014  Indore – 75.4 mm  Bhopal – 61 mm 254\n",
      "RAIPUR: With one more person being washed away in an overflowing drain in Janjgir district on Wednesday, the death toll in the raging floods in Chhattisgarh reached three. As nearly 700 villages remain marooned in the districts of Gariyaband, Mahasamund, Kanker, Bastar, Janjgir, and Bemetara, evacuations have been carried out in several low lying areas to ensure the safety of the people.While there has been some respite from the rains in the past 24 hours, the over 350 mm of rains in two days (Monday and Tuesday) has caused havoc in the affected districts. Majority of the rivers in the state - Sodur, Pari, Jonk, Tale, Indravati, Mahanadi, Shivnath and Doodh - continue to be in spate with waters flowing above the danger marks. Water level in most of the dams in the state continues to be at critical levels.In Janjgir district, nearly 200 people have been evacuated from Shivrinarian and Chandrapur areas and shifted to community centres, as water from the Mahanadi River inundated their homes. According to district collector, OP Choudhary, the administration is on a high alert as water level in Mahanadi was at least five feet above the danger mark.Choudhary said connectivity of several inundated villages had been cut off to Raigarh and Sarangarh. He said due to blockage in Shivrinarain Sabri Setu, connectivity between Raipur and Balodabazar was also cut off.The collector confirmed the death of a middle-aged man, who was washed away in the Dhanuar Nala. Water had entered several localities and even the hospital and the bus stand near the Nagar Panchayat at Shivrinarain area was flooded.In Bemetara district release of over 80,000 cusecs of water from the Mogra dam in Rajnandgaon resulted in flooding of several low-lying areas in the district. Collector, B Raju, told TOI that water was flowing over 4 feet above the danger mark at Simga bridge. He said several parts of the districts were cut off from from Raipur and Jabalpur due to flooded roads.He said the water level in Shivnath river water was still above the danger mark.With not much rains in the past 24 hours, the situation in the other affected districts of Gariyaband, Mahasamund, Kanker and Bastar remained under control. Though hundreds of villages still remain marooned, the respite from rains has prevented the situation from going from bad to worse.According to officials these districts still remain on an alert and efforts were on to move people from low-lying areas to safer locations.While the state has so far recorded 516.7 MM of rains since June 1, over 444 mm of downpour has been received in the past 72 hours.

      "PATNA, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Authorities were rushing food rations, clothes and cooking utensils to villagers in Bihar on Thursday after a storm killed at least 48 people and left thousands more homeless, government officials said.  With wind speeds of up to 70 km per hour (43 mph) and heavy rains, the storm struck the eastern state late on Tuesday, uprooting trees and electricity poles, ripping through farmland and destroying over 25,000 mud-and-thatch homes.  State officials said 12 of Bihar's 38 districts had been affected, including Purnia, Madhepura and Saharsa.  \"Now we are rushing relief, food items and utensils to the affected families,\" Anirudh Kumar, a state disaster management official, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  As well as ripping apart homes and destroying possessions, the storm also flattened banana plantations and maize and wheat fields, causing many villagers to lose their livelihoods, he said.  Officials said they were still assessing the scale of the devastation, a process hindered by snapped telecommunication lines and villages cut off by uprooted trees blocking roads.  \"The damage is huge although we cannot provide the exact figure because we are still assessing the extent of damage,\" said Sudhir Kumar, a senior official in Purnia.  Bihar's governor Keshari Nath Tripathi has asked the state government to provide 400,000 rupees ($6,300) in compensation to each of the victims' families.  Weather officials said because the storm developed quickly, there was not enough time to issue an early warning and evacuate villagers to shelters.  India is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, and many of its 1.2 billion people live in areas vulnerable to natural hazards such as floods, cyclones, droughts and earthquakes.  In 2008, major flooding in Bihar triggered by heavy monsoons left more than 500 people dead and disrupted the lives of two million others.  (Writing by Nita Bhalla; Editing by Katie Nguyen) 258\n"

      "Nearly 1.2 millio­n people are now stayin­g in around 1,600 relief camps opened in school­s and govern­ment office­s  KOLKATA: Floods from days of torrential rain have now claimed at least 180 lives in India with one million people sheltering in relief camps after fleeing surging waters, officials said Tuesday.  Rivers have burst their banks, hitting thousands of villages in parts of West Bengal as well as northeastern Manipur state, where roads and bridges have been cut and communications were patchy.  Most of those 180 died from drowning, while at least four people have been killed in a landslide that buried a remote village in Manipur bordering Myanmar, where heavy monsoon rains have also wreaked havoc.  The death toll jumped from around 120 on Monday, after the discovery of more bodies in West Bengal and the western state of Gujarat where water levels have receded, allowing families to return home.  “The death toll due to flooding in West Bengal rose to 70, with roads and farms in 13,200 villages remaining under water,” disaster management minister Javed Ahmad Khan told AFP.  “Nearly 1.2 million people are now staying in around 1,600 relief camps opened in schools and government offices,” he said.  The release of water from brimming dams has exacerbated the flooding in West Bengal after Cyclone Komen struck the east coast on Friday, Khan said.  “Rivers in 13 districts are flowing over their danger marks. The situation is grim.”  Another five people have died in Orissa and 35 in northern Rajasthan state, officials there said.  “The worst is over. Now we are focusing on relief and rehabilitation of affected people,” Rajasthan’s disaster minister, Gulab Singh Kataria, told AFP.  In Manipur, television footage showed villagers erecting a bamboo bridge over a muddy river after flood waters left them stranded, and a child trying to cross by floating in a rubber tyre.  Rescuers were still searching for villagers feared buried in a landslide that struck their hamlet on Saturday, with four bodies found, Jason Shimray, an official overseeing the rescue operation, said.  Shimray said 10 people feared killed in the landslide have been found alive, although details were sketchy.  In the western state of Gujarat, flooding has eased in recent days, but the death toll has reached 72 after the discovery of more bodies, director of relief operations Bipin Bhatt told AFP.  India, which receives nearly 80 per cent of its annual rainfall from June to September, sees tragedy strike every monsoon season.  Read full story 259\n",

      "AGARTALA: Union home minister Rajnath Singh will meet the chief ministers of Tripura and Mizoram in Agartala on Saturday for the repatriation of 31,223 Brus residing in six camps of North Tripura.State revenue minister Badal Choudhury on Thursday told the assembly that Singh, accompanied by minister of state for home Kiren Rijiju and top officials of the ministry of home affairs (MHA), will come to Agartala on Saturday morning by a special BSF aircraft from Imphal.Singh and his 11-member team will go to Khantlang by an IAF chopper from Agartala to review India's border management initiative. He will hold a meeting with BSF officials at Khantlang followed by a visit to the areas which are geographically connected to the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh in a helicopter. The areas are now being used by militants for cross-border movement.Then, he is scheduled to hold a meeting with Bru leaders residing in Tripura camps over their repatriation to Mizoram. Upon reaching Agartala after lunch, Singh and his team will hold a meeting with Tripura CM Manik Sarkar and Mizoram CM Lalthanhawala at the state guest house.Later in the evening, he will leave for New Delhi by a BSF aircraft. This is for the first time in the last 18 years that a Union home minister is holding a meeting on repatriation with the chief ministers of both Tripura and Mizoram.In October, 1997, as many as 35,326 Brus of western Mizoram took shelter in six camps of Kanchanpur in North Tripura following ethnic clashes. Tripura minister Choudhury alleged that long stay of Bru migrants has caused serious damage to the bio-diversity and ecology of the entire middle-eastern part of Kanchanpur. The rich flora and fauna of Jumpui and Shakhan-Shermun ranges have been affected seriously that led to uncertainty in livelihood of indigenous people of the area.\"The migrants have occupied about 773 acres of forest and government land of which about 19.19 acres are allotted to tribal families under Recognition of Forest Right Act. But there are not allowed to use it,\" said Choudhury.Moreover, there are growing cases of clashes between migrant Brus and indigenous people which has become a serious law and order problem for the state, he added. At least three militant outfits are reportedly using the camps for insurgency activities in the area, he alleged. 265\n"

      "Image copyright AP Image caption Both India and Pakistan have accused each other of starting the latest hostilities  Thousands of villagers have fled their homes in Indian-administered Kashmir as Indian and Pakistani troops continue to exchange fire in the region.  At least 10 Indian and Pakistani soldiers and civilians have been killed in the violence over the past week.  Both sides have accused each other of starting the hostilities.  A ceasefire agreed in 2003 remains in place, but the neighbours often accuse each other of violating it.  The latest round of hostilities come days before US Secretary of State John Kerry is due to visit India. President Barack Obama is also due to visit India as the chief guest at the country's Republic Day celebrations on 26 January.  Some 10,000 civilians living in border villages on the Indian side have fled their homes since fighting began last week, a senior official named Shantmanu told Reuters news agency.  \"We had a narrow escape and there is a war-like situation,\" Sham Kumar, 54, an affected villager said.  \"Pakistani troops are using long-range weapons. It is the first time we have seen such intense shelling.\"  He said he had left his village after a shell landed in a school about 3.5km (2 miles) from the border.  India and Pakistan are continuing to exchange fire in the disputed region on Tuesday, reports say.  Image copyright EPA Image caption Hostilities between the neighbours have escalated in the past year  \"The firing is going on and we are giving befitting reply to Pakistani shelling,\" an Indian official said.  Pakistan said on Monday that its soldiers were \"effectively responding to India's [unprovoked] firing\".  A Pakistani military statement said four civilians, including a woman and a teenage boy, had been killed by Indian fire near the city of Sialkot since Sunday.  India said one of its soldiers was killed by Pakistani fire in the Samba area on Monday.  Last week, Indian forces in Kashmir killed four Pakistani troops on the border after an Indian soldier was killed in an attack blamed on Pakistan. Pakistan said it had lodged a protest with the Indian high commissioner in Islamabad.  Hostilities between the neighbours have escalated in the past year.  In October, 16 people - nine Pakistanis and seven Indians - died when the two sides exchanged fire for several days.  Correspondents say 2014 saw an escalation in hostilities between the neighbours, with some of the worst violence in a decade. Both sides have accused each other of initiating the clashes.  Earlier in the summer, India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif to his inauguration and there were hopes that relations between Delhi and Islamabad would improve.  But relations have deteriorated since then, with India cancelling scheduled talks with Pakistan in August and insisting that Delhi would \"not tolerate acts of border violations by Pakistan\" and that \"ceasefire violations must stop\".  Kashmir, claimed by both countries in its entirety, has been a flashpoint for more than 60 years and the South Asian rivals have fought two wars over the region. 268\n",
      "Some 20,000 Indians have fled to relief camps while at least 2,000 Pakistanis have sought shelter with relatives, or in open fields  By Fayaz Bukhari and Katharine Houreld  P.S. PORA, India/SIALKOT, Pakistan, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - It was a balmy night when mortar struck the courtyard of Shahdin Mohammad's home, killing his son and grandson and injuring three other family members who were asleep outside.  He knelt on the ground, cradling his 12-year-old grandson, shouting for help, but by the time a neighbour arrived and drove them to the nearest clinic, it was too late.  \"The firing started at 2 a.m. and we had nowhere to go. We were outside our home and a shell landed right in front of us,\" said Mohammad, a 65-year-old Indian farmer from Jeora Farm village. \"That was the end of the world for me.\"  Located about one kilometre (0.62 mile) from India's border with Pakistan, Jeora Farm is one of scores of villages in the disputed Kashmir region being hit by increasing exchange of fire between the two nations.  During an 11 year lull in fighting along this stretch of the border after a 2003 ceasefire, villages grew on both sides, with brick buildings replacing mud huts and schools and wedding halls opening close to check-points but that peace is now shattered.  In August when Mohammad's family was killed, the firing went on for 45 days, affecting rice production and schooling for many children. This month has seen a renewed bout of fighting.  The firing, usually restricted to military posts, has killed 23 civilians this year, the highest death toll in over a decade, and prompted accusations of the deliberate targeting civilians.  This month nine Pakistanis and eight Indians were killed in the latest spat between the South Asian nuclear-armed neighbours.  Amid the fighting some 20,000 Indians have fled to relief camps while at least 2,000 Pakistanis have sought shelter with relatives, or in open fields, out of the range of fire.  \"There is good reason for concern,\" said Michael Kugelman, Senior Program Associate for South and Southeast Asia at the Woodrow Wilson International Institute for Scholars.  \"Not only are we seeing more civilian casualties than is typically the case, but we're also seeing cases of children wounded and killed by shelling ... It's expanded into a humanitarian tragedy.\"  DELIBERATE TARGETS  India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947, two of them over the mostly-Muslim region of Kashmir with its Himalayan mountains and fertile valleys which they both claim in full but rule in part.  Although the tit-for-tat artillery fire frequently rattles the so-called Line of Control (LoC), separating Indian- and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, the clashes have intensified.  Indian military officials say there have been over 110 ceasefire violations by Pakistan so far this year compared to 347 in 2013 and 114 in 2012.  Islamabad says there have been 227 violations by New Delhi this year, against 414 in 2013 and 230 the year before.  But Chief Minister of Indian-administered Kashmir has accused Pakistan of a change in tactic and targeting civilians.  \"Such a large scale loss to the civilians clearly indicates they have changed their strategy from engaging in cross-firing with the forces on this side of border to specifically targeting the civilian areas,\" Omar Abdullah told journalists this week.  Pakistani military officials deny the claim.  Major General Khan Tahir Javed Khan said the Pakistani army only fires mortars back and never at civilians.  He claimed India has fired 19,733 mortars into his 193 km (120 mile) stretch of the disputed border so far this year, compared to 180 in 2012.  \"Our main fire is concentrated onto their posts, not onto their villages,\" Khan insisted.  One mortar hit Irum Shahzadi's home in the Pakistani village of Dhamala early Monday as her three sons leapt out of bed, excited about celebrating the Muslim holiday of Eid.  \"I could not see anything, because of the dark (smoke), so I started groping on the floor. I found my younger son, and lifted him into my lap,\" said Shahzadi, weeping uncontrollably.  \"My entire world has collapsed ... My sons ... one had no face, the other was hit in the chest and in the arms.\"  Two of the boys died.  IN THE LINE OF FIRE  In the lush Basmati rice-growing plains of India's R.S. Pora sector, the skirmishes temporarily displace thousands of people who move into schools turned into relief camps and this can disrupt the lives of everyone from children to farmers.  \"First, it was dry weather that affected our crops. Then when it rained, the firing drove us away from the village,\" said Vicky Kumar, a farmer in Abdullain village on the Indian side.  \"We couldn't apply fertilisers and this led to the crop failing. We expect only 50 percent yield this year.\"  Children complain of not being able to go to school, saying even when the guns fall silent, they are too scared to go out.  But the biggest challenge facing villagers in this stretch of border comes at night when the mortars fall.  In the Pakistani village of Dhamala, Wazir Bibi said she and her four daughters were always scared but couldn't leave.  \"Every time I hear the blasts, if feels like my heart will burst from my body,\" said Bibi, 65. \"We are women and poor, we cannot sleep in the fields, we have nowhere to go.\"  \"HELL'S VILLAGE\"  However some villagers living along border said they had benefited from 2003 ceasefire agreement.  In the Indian town of Arnia, people farm their land right up to the international border and have turned their mud houses into two-storey structures with satellite dishes and bathrooms.  Residents proudly point to a wedding hall as a sign of normality, saying previously few marriages occurred here as families refused to marry their daughters to young men living in a place once nicknamed \"Hell's village\".  Shops sell cement and floor tiles to feed a construction boom and a 30 km stretch of road from Jammu town to the border crossing of Suchetgarh is being widened to four lanes.  The plan was to eventually open the area for trade between the two nations, but that seems a distant reality now.  Islamabad and New Delhi blame one another for initiating the border shelling, both saying that they will not back down first.  Pakistan on Thursday said it was capable of responding \"befittingly\" to India, while India said Pakistan would pay an \"unaffordable price\" if it persisted with the shelling.  The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday expressed concern over deaths and displacement of civilians, while human rights groups have warned of the violatation of international humanitarian laws if claims of targeting civilians are true.  \"They should investigate any allegations of violations including the indiscriminate use of weapons such as heavy artillery in densely populated areas, using civilians as human shields, or otherwise placing them at unnecessary risk,\" said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director for Human Rights Watch.

      "Troops deployed as tribal rampage leaves 32 dead in northeastern India  Updated  India has deployed troops to the state of Assam on Saturday after at least 32 were killed following days of deadly tribal violence in the northeastern state of Assam.  Soldiers in convoys of trucks mounted with rifles are patrolling in Baksa district, where some of the attacks took place.  The violence erupted on Thursday after tribal rebels killed three villagers in Baksa district and eight more in neighbouring Kokrahjar.  The rebels opened fire on the victims as they slept in their homes.  Similar violence, also perpetrated by the tribal rebels, 12 muslims dead on Friday  Police have found nine more bodies, including those of women and children, from Narayanguri village in Baksa district, 200 kilometres from Assam's main city of Guwahati.  Authorities say all the victims were Muslim migrants who have been locked in land disputes with indigenous Bodo tribes in the state, which shares borders with Bangladesh and Bhutan.  Local police said the attacks have forced 5,000 people to flee from their homes.  The violence has also prompted a massive manhunt for the rebels, with police accusing the outlawed National Democratic Front of Bodoland, which has been fighting for a separate homeland, for the attacks.  \"Security has been further tightened with police and paramilitary troopers deployed in strength,\" said police Inspector General S. N. Singh.  Inspector Singh said an indefinite curfew has been imposed the affected districts, with police being given shoot-on-sight orders.  On Sunday, Muslims in Baksa were refusing to bury 18 of those killed, in a protest against authorities whom they blame for failing to protect them.  \"Right now we are sitting in the open with 18 bodies in front of us,\" said Lafiqul Islam, president of the All Bengali Muslim Students Union.  \"We will continue with our protest and not perform the funeral until and unless the chief minister personally visits the spot.\"  The attacks have occurred in the midst of the Indian general elections, which began on April 7 and expected to end on May 12.  In 2012, ethnic clashes in the same area killed around 100 people and displaced more than 400,000.  AFP/Reuters  Topics: unrest-conflict-and-war, india  First posted 273\n",
      "DEMAND PROTECTION:Rengma Nagas of Karbi Anglong district stage a protest demanding security for the community against “atrocities” by KPLT militants and the creation of a Rengma Hills Autonomous Council, in Guwahati on Thursday. --PHOTO: PTI  : The situation on the Assam-Nagaland border, which had recently witnessed unrest following clashes between the Rengma Nagas and Karbis, is gradually returning to normal.  The Rengma Naga and Karbi families, who had taken shelter in nine relief camps following a violent clash in Karbi Anglong district on December 27 last, have started returning to their homes.  Over 3,000 people were displaced due to clashes between ethnic insurgent Karbi People’s Liberation Tigers (KPLT) and the Rengma Naga Hills Protection Force (RNHPF).  Centre assures all help  The Central government has assured the State government of all possible help to prevent violence.  The security forces are providing them adequate security, and the Assam government has assured that there will be no further violence in the area.  “Around 3,000 Rengma Nagas have left the camps and are headed for home, and some 600 are still in the camps. NIA or CBI enquiry will be conducted into the killing of nine Karbis in Nagaland,” said Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi.  The Nagaland government has also assured that it would ensure the safety of Karbis in the State after nine of them were killed near Chumukedima near Dimapur.  Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio recently called on Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde in Delhi to apprise him of the prevailing situation arising out of the recent ethnic clashes.  ‘Hope peace prevails’  “The Home Minister said that he will deploy sufficient forces. He will also tell the Assam CM to ensure that peace prevails in that area. I hope that he will keep his commitment. When I met the Assam CM, he also assured me. So, we all are hoping that peace will prevail,” said Mr. Rio.  The Union Home Minister said that the Centre was monitoring the situation, and assured Assam and Nagaland of necessary security support.  “We are watching the situation in Nagaland and the border area of Assam and Nagaland, particularly Manipur. There have been incidents between Karbi Anglong and other groups,” said Mr. Shinde.  The Centre has deployed additional 10 companies of the Central Reserve Police Force to prevent violence in the region. Efforts are on to curb the menace of the Karbi People’s Liberation Tigers and the Rengma Naga Hills Protection Force, who are trying to divide people over ethnicity. — ANI 274\n",

      "Image caption A danger zone is being enforced around Mount Sinabung  An active volcano in western Indonesia has let out a series of fresh eruptions, forcing around 19,000 people to flee their homes, officials say.  Mt Sinabung, on the island of Sumatra, erupted nine times late on Monday, shooting lava and gas up to 7,000m (23,000 ft) in the air, officials said.  A 5km (3 mile) danger zone is being enforced around the volcano's crater.  It has been showing signs of life since September, after being dormant for three years.  \"On Monday night, 19,126 people fled their homes, and we expect that number to rise,\" National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.  \"Mount Sinabung remains on the highest alert level,\" he said, adding that police and soldiers were patrolling the danger zone to evacuate people.  When the volcano erupted in 2010, at least two people were killed and 30,000 others were displaced.  Before 2010, Mount Sinabung had not erupted in 400 years. It is one of around 130 active volcanoes in the country. 279\n"

      "More than 5,200 residents of the Dieng Plateau in Central Java are continuing to take refuge in Batur district, some 10 kilometers from the plateau, following Friday's earthquake.    While residents were reportedly not troubled by aftershocks from the 4.8-magnitude temblor, many voiced concerns about poisonous outgassing from a number of active volcanoes on the plateau.    Some residents, mostly men, braved the odds to return and to check their houses and property, while their children remained in the shelters.    The earthquake on Friday was the largest since the emergency status for the Dieng Plateau was increased to alert (siaga), the second-highest warning level, at the end of March, leading to the evacuation.    'So far, we are still ordering thousands of residents to stay at the shelters because of the possible aftershocks and poisonous gas threats that may appear at any time,' Banjarnegara Deputy Regent Hadi Supeno told The Jakarta Post on Sunday.    Hadi said that the authorities wanted to avoid a repeat of the 1979 incident when 149 residents of the plateau died after inhaling poisonous gas from Sinila Crater.    Timbang Crater Monitoring Command Post official Andri Sulistyo said that the residents taking refuge were from a number of villages, including Pekasiran, Sumberejo, Karangtengah and Kepakisan.    'They have been taking refuge at seven locations in Batur district and in Dieng Kulon village,' he said.    Andri added that there were no victims from Friday's quake, although 250 homes had been damaged.    Meanwhile, the head of the Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation Center (PVBMG), Surono, said that roads around Timbang Crater and those linking Dieng with Batur and Simpangan with Pekasiran had been reopened since Saturday.    'The roads were opened after no poisonous gas was detected and to facilitate evacuation traffic,' Surono said.    Separately, the head of the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency's (BMKG) Banjarnegara station, Ahmad Lani, said the epicenter of Friday's temblor was located about 11 kilometers northwest of Wonosobo at a depth of 10 kilometers.    The earthquake was felt in nearby Banjarnegara and Wonosobo regencies as far as Batang regency to the north.    The Dieng Plateau is located in Banjarnegara and Wonosobo regencies, west of the Sindoro and Sumbing mountain ranges.    The plateau has eight active craters and three summits, Mt. Prahu, Mt. Pakuwaja and Mt. Sikunir. 280\n",

      "Heavy rainfall in Borneo and Sumatra over the last 3 days has left parts of Malaysia and Indonesia struggling with yet more flooding. Malaysia is still recovering from the floods of December 2014 in the north of the country, which were some of the worst flooding seen in years.  Sarawak, Malaysia  In Borneo, over 5,000 people have been evacuated in the flood-hit state of Sarawak. This figure has dropped slightly from almost 7,000 earlier today. 38 relief centres have been set up to house those displaced by the floods.  The worst affected area is around the state capital of Kuching, where at one point almost 5,000 were staying in temporary accommodation. Just over 1,000 people have been displaced in Padawan.  One flood-related death has been reported in Mukah, when a teenage girl drowned after a boat capsized in rough waters.  Power Outages  The heavy rain has caused power outages in Limbang, Bau and Lundu after Sarawak Energy Bhd (SEB) said it had shut down several substations in areas affected by torrential rain  Flood Waters Receding but More Rain Forecast  Some reports say that the flood water have started to recede, at least in some places, allowing almost 2,000 to return to their homes. Malaysia’s Drainage and Irrigation Department say there are currently no rivers with water levels at the danger point.  The rainfall over the last 24 hours has been less intense. 64 mm of rain fell in Kuching in 24 hours yesterday, compared to over 250 mm the day before.  However, further heavy rainfall has been forecast for parts of Borneo, including parts of Sarawak, and the Malaysian Meteorological Department has issued Orange level severe weather warnings.  East Kalimantan, Indonesia  Just over the border from Sarawak, the Indonesian provinces of East and West Kalimantan has also been affected by heavy rain and flooding over the last 3 days. Over 160 mm of rain fell in 24 hours in Putussibau yesterday, according to WMO.  Around 1,000 people have been evacuated in East Kalimantan after a river overflowed in the province.  Sumatra  Elsewhere in Indonesia, over 2,000 people have been evacuated in Aceh province after floods in South Aceh regency that first struck almost one week ago. Pidie Jaya regency has also been badly affected and 4,000 houses have been reportedly damaged as a result. 306\n",
      "Hundreds of residents of Siau, Sitaro Islands regency, North Sulawesi, have fled to safer ground after Mount Karangetang erupted.    Mt. Karangetang erupted at 12:30 p.m. local time on Thursday, prompting residents in Bebali subdistrict, East Siau district, in Siau, Tagulandang and Biaro (Sitaro) Islands regency to seek refuge.    Thursday's eruption discharged lava and sent volcanic ash and pyroclastic flows in the direction of the Batuawang River in East Siau district. The eruption caused panic among residents, who fled the area. People initially took shelter in the Bebali subdistrict office, but moved to the East Siau district administrative office in Ulu after volcanic activity increased.    Mt. Karangetang Observation Station head Yudia Tatipang said the volcano's alert status remained the same despite the significant increase in volcanic activity.    'The alert status remains at level 3. Pyroclastic flows frequently occur,' said Yudia by phone.    He added that the volcano activity gave no signs of abating soon. 'Residents are advised not to return home until further notice,' he said.    'This is the first time we have witnessed a massive eruption,' said Bebali district resident Junico Kasiuhe, 35.    According to Junico, Bebeli residents panicked and fled to safety.    'Residents are terrified of the pyroclastic flows as they are rapid and hundreds of lives could be lost in a matter of seconds. That's why we immediately took the initiative to evacuate,' said Junico.    Kanang villager Harto Narasiang said the wind had carried volcanic ash to Karalung and Kanang villages in East Siau district.    'The blanket of ash can be 2 centimeters thick and has affected roads in both villages,' said Harto.    Sitaro Disaster Mitigation Center (BPBD) head Bob Wuaten said village administration offices had evacuated about 2,000 residents.    'The BPBD has evacuated about 465 residents to three shelters from both villages,' said Bob.    Besides the shelters, residents have also taken shelter at other residents' homes. 'We evacuated those living within a 200-meter radius from the lava flow. Currently, four homes have been buried by volcanic ash,' he said.    He added that the North Sulawesi provincial administration, BPBD and the local health office had provided relief aid. He urged residents to remain alert and to wear masks, especially those living along the Batuawang River.    East Siau district chief Wilman Panguliman said there was still volcanic activity as of Friday afternoon, although not as much as Thursday.    He added that aid supplies remained available, but evacuees needed mattresses and blankets.    Mt. Karangetang is also known as Api Siau, or Siau Fire. It is one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia as it has erupted more than 40 times since 1675 and has had undocumented innumerable minor eruptions. An eruption in 1997 killed three people, while in August 2010 four people went missing during an evacuation effort.    The volcano is among a number of other volcanoes currently showing signs of activity, including mounts Soputan and Lokon in North Sulawesi, Mt. Gamalama in North Maluku, Mt. Slamet in Central Java and Mt. Sinabung in North Sumatra. 307\n",

      "A 6.6-magnitude earthquake hit in waters off Indonesia's easternmost province early Friday, injuring dozens of people, damaging buildings and sending panicked residents fleeing from homes, hotels and even a hospital.  The quake, which struck at 12:53 a.m., was centered 17 miles north of Sorong, a town in Indonesia's West Papua province, the U.S. Geological Survey said on its website. It occurred at a depth of 15 miles.  Hundreds of people fled their homes in panic in Sorong and at least 39 people were hurt, mostly with broken bones, said Petrus Korisano from the local disaster mitigation agency. Nearly 260 houses and buildings were damaged.  Hundreds of people were evacuated to temporary shelters as authorities surveyed the damage, said Korisano.  The panic extended to Manokwari city, 195 miles to the west of the epicenter, where hundreds of patients from at least one hospital had to be evacuated, some in wheelchairs or with IVs attached to their arms, said Burhanudin, an official at the disaster mitigation agency in the city, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. Hotels emptied and residents ran into the streets and higher ground in the Raja Ampat popular tourist destination.  An official from Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency, Budi Waluyo, said the underwater quake had no potential to generate tsunami waves along nearby coasts.  The world's largest archipelago, Indonesia is prone to earthquakes due to its location on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.  In 2004, a monster temblor off the shores of Aceh in Indonesia triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries. Most of the deaths were in Aceh province.

      "This estimate is based on data obtained from various sources, including government agencies, international NGOs, UN agencies and the media. The government collects data on displacement caused by natural hazards and conflict (“social conflicts”) through the National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB). However, with regards to conflict-related displacement, government IDP records do not cover all regions of the country or all displacements events. According to official figures, conflict and violence displaced 11,979 people between 2006 and 2015, including 505 in 2014. No displacement was recorded in the first 6 months of 2015 (BNPB, July 2015). However, this figure is likely to significantly under-estimate total displacement as it did not take into account ongoing displacement in Papua and West Papua provinces, as well as a number of displacement events elsewhere in the country. In August 2014 for example, some 500 people were reported displaced in Lembata, East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), following inter-communal violence (Tempo, 18 August 2014). This was not included in the records of the BNPB.  At the end of December 2014, BNPB reported that 2.6 million people had been displaced by natural hazard-related disasters in 2014 (Jakarta Post, 31 December 2014). However, available data from the BNPB database shows a much lower total, at 856,720 people (BNPB, January 2015).  Collecting data on protracted displacement is complicated by the fact that many of the conflicts that have led to large-scale displacement took place more than 15 years ago and that information on the whereabouts and needs of IDPs, returnees and those who locally integrated or settled elsewhere is often not available. There is also no monitoring of return or other settlement options or any assessment of the extent to which these have been sustainable. While a number of programs implemented in recent years by local and international agencies in provinces such as Aceh, Maluku and East Nusa Tenggara have made partial data available, in others such as North Maluku, Central Sulawesi and West and Central Kalimantan no data has been available since 2005.  Breakdown of IDP figures by provinces  North Sumatra: (Langkat): 530 households (3,000 people)  Maluku (Ambon & Seram): 1,123 households (5,400 people)  North Sulawesi (Bitung): 120 households (540 people)  East Nusa Tengarra (West Timor): 4,762 households (22,000 people)  West Nusa Tengarra (West Lombok): 37 households (161 people)  East Java (Sidoarjo): 72 households (343 people)  Most IDPs live in protracted displacement  Nearly all the 31,440 IDPs were displaced by inter-communal violence or insurgency-related violence between 1998 and 2004 and have since been unable or unwilling to return and have failed to re-establish their lives through local integration or settlement elsewhere. The majority are located in Aceh, Maluku and East Nusa Tenggara (in particular West Timor) provinces. Others live in North Sulawesi and North Sumatra. The estimate also includes a number of people displaced between 2007 and 2013 by attacks against religious minorities (West Nusa Tenggara and East Java provinces) and who have since failed to return.  IDPs included in the estimate live in both urban and rural areas, mostly in makeshift shelters or resettlement camps.  North Sumatra  In Langkat district, North Sumatra, where many ethnic Javanese who fled the Aceh conflict between 1999 and 2003 attempted to locally integrate and rebuild their lives, some 530 households, or some 3,000 people, living in Sei Lepan camp have been in a long-running land dispute with the local government (Medan Bisnis, 10 February 2015). The displaced are accused of encroaching on the protected Gunung Leuser National Park (BBTNGL, 22 March 2011).  Maluku and North Sulawesi  In Maluku, there are still some 1,123 households, or 5,400 individuals, displaced in the early 2000s who have since been living with host families and temporary settlements in four sub-districts (Buru, South Buru, central Maluku and West Seram) and who remain in need of assistance (IDMC interviews, May 2015).  In addition, some people may be displaced in the province as a result of more recent violence but their number is unknown. Sporadic violence has affected the province in recent years. In February 2012, some 4,000 people fled their village in Pelauw, Central Maluku, following intra-communal violence (AF, 22 February 2012). In 2014, a total of 311 people fled their homes in two separate conflict incidents in West Seram and Central maluku regencies between July and August (BNPB, April 2015).  Many people who fled the conflict in neighbouring North Maluku headed for North Sulawesi where the majority settled permanently (Duncan, 2008, p.16). At least 418 families, or 1,918 people, have been living in 5 settlements since 2000 with lack of access to basic services and no tenure security (Habitat for Humanity, October 2012). During 2013 and 2014, some 270 households were provided with new homes and tenure security, leaving 120 families, or 540 people, still in need of assistance (Habitat for Humanity, interview, 6 May 2015).  East Nusa Tenggara (West Timor)  From the estimated 113,000 people who chose to locally integrate in West Timor after they fled in 1999 from what is now Timor-Leste, some 22,000 continue to live in camps in and around the city of Kupang, requiring livelihood and shelter assistance (Jakarta Post, 17 January 2014).  West Nusa Tenggara and East Java  Since 2011, growing religious intolerance has led to a rise in attacks by Islamist militants against religious minorities, sometimes resulting in their displacement (CWS, 14 February 2014;Setara Institute, 18 January 2014). In East Java, some 343 members of the Shia community evicted from their homes in Sampang regency in December 2011 and again in August 2012 remain displaced (IDMC, May 2015). In West Lombok Regency, West Nusa Tenggara, some 161 members of the Ahmadi Islamic movement displaced in 2006 have since not been able to return to their homes (IDMC interviews, May 2015).  Papua and West Papua  In Papua, the long-running armed conflict between the Indonesian Armed Forces and the non-state armed group the Free Papua Movement – Organisasi Papua Merdeka (OPM) has mainly displaced people living in remote rural areas. Tens of thousands have been displaced in the past 30 years, many fleeing towards Papua New Guinea settling in camps on both sides of the border (UNHCR, March 2006) where they remain today (JRS, 22 July 2013). In the absence of accurate data on how many are located on the Indonesian side they are not included in the estimate. The number of people still displaced in Papua and West Papua as a result of more recent military operations is unknown. As in previous years, several hundred people were displaced in 2014 and 2015 by military operations in the Central Highland region and in Timika, Mimika regency, but it is unknown whether they were all able to return (AWPA, 9 February 2014,The Guardian, 13 January 2015).  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it. 313\n",

      "Heavy rain and flooding since late October have left almost 70 people dead in Iran and Iraq. The UN have said that the flooding in Iraq has exacerbated a cholera outbreak.  Iraq Floods  At least 58 people have died in flash floods over the last week across Iraq, the country’s Health Ministry has said on Friday 06 November 2015.  Many of the victims were killed by electrocution caused by rain-related incidents in several parts of the country. One of the worst hit areas has been the capital Baghdad, where 65,000 residents have been affected by the overflow sewage system due to the extensive flooding, according to UNICEF, adding to the increased risk of cholera.  Floods have also affected areas outside the capital, including Wasit governorate to the south east. The Iraqi Red Crescent Society (IRCS) said that it had evacuated a number of families from their flooded homes in the districts of Badra and Aldboney.  Mr. Haider Al-gaderey, IRCS’s relief team leader said, “A number of houses in the Badra and Aldboney districts have collapsed due to rising in the levels of heavy rains water, and also the flow of water which coming from Iran”.  “IRCS’s relief teams in Wasit, in cooperation with the army aviation, has evacuated families that besieged by floods and take them to safer places, and now they are in good health, as the IRCS’s teams provided them with shelter and food”.  2,200 Cases of Cholera in Iraq  UN agencies and their partners are working to combat a cholera outbreak in Iraq that so far has resulted in more than 2,200 cases of the disease.  “There is unfortunately a high risk that cholera will reach more areas of Iraq, affecting marginalized and displaced children, women and their families in particular, so we have to act fast,” UNICEF Representative in Iraq Peter Hawkins said in a statement made on 06 November 2015.  He added, “Heavy rains in late October inundated several areas of the country considered vulnerable to the spread of cholera”  According to the statement, “since the cholera outbreak was confirmed in mid-September, UNICEF has supported the distribution of bottled water to 37,000 people, and water trucking at a rate of 100,000 litres per day, benefiting 5,000 people. Community water tanks sufficient for 15,500 people have been installed, and family water and hygiene kits distributed to 44,250 families.”  Cholera is caused by contaminated food or water. It can lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not provided quickly.  Floods in Iran Since October 2015  Meanwhile in neighbouring Iran, at least 9 people have been killed and 9 others injured in floods and severe weather that struck in late October 2015. International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) say that 24 provinces have been affected in northern and western Iran.  According to IFRC, about 400 Red Crescent Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran National Society teams of 1,800 relief workers and rescuers were mobilised and equipped with 310 vehicles, 50 motor pumps and two helicopters to respond to the emergency situation and offer the much needed aid to the affected communities, reaching more than 17,700 people.  Dr Naser Charkhsaz, the head of the Relief and Rescue Organization at the Red Crescent detailed on the operations of the National Society during and in the aftermath of the flooding: “Red Crescent volunteers pumped water out of 1,300 houses and the National Society’s emergency health teams treated 11 people and transferred 93 others to medical centres. Eighteen people trapped under the rubble were also rescued by the volunteers and 39 were evacuated to safer areas.”  Dr Charkhsaz added that the Red Crescent Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran provided shelter to 1,400 people affected by the storms and the floods. The Iranian National Society also got involved in the distribution of relief items to people in the flood-hit areas, and these items included 180 tents, 5,400 blankets, 1,900 mats, 570 kitchen sets, 500 heaters, 2,400 parcels of canned food, 10,000 loaves of bread and 4,300 bottles of water. 8,500 kilograms of relief consignments were also dispatched to flood-hit areas.  The Red Crescent’s emergency response teams are still actively carrying out relief operations in the provinces of Ilam, Lorestan and Kerman. 317\n",

      "Wildfires broke out across Israel for the second day in a row on Sunday, as unseasonably hot weather and heavy winds sent firefighters scrambling to battle blazes throughout the day.    At Ma’asiyahu Prison in central Israel, 11 people were lightly injured from smoke inhalation, including seven guards, an inmate and three firefighters, after a fire at a woodworking factory in the compound spread out of control.  Relevant to your professional network? Please share on Linkedin  Dozens of fire teams and police swarmed to the scene to battle the blaze, which spread to the prison grounds.By mid-afternoon, Shfela subdistrict police said the fire was under control and denied reports they were preparing to evacuate prisoners from the facility. The smoke inhalation casualties were taken to Assaf Harofeh Medical Center in Tzrifin for treatment.Also in the Shfela region, firefighters evacuated a resident of Moshav Rambam due to a grass fire, and battled another brush blaze in nearby Karmei Yosef.In the Sharon subdistrict, firefighters fought blazes at Poleg Beach, Even Yehuda junction and in Rosh Ha’ayin.The Rosh Ha’ayin fire came the day after a massive fire at a car-parts warehouse in the area that dozens of crews fought for hours before managing to extinguish it.Other fires broke out in the northern and southern districts of the country, with most of the blazes in open areas being blamed on the harsh weather conditions.Yoram Levy, spokesman for the Fire and Rescue Services, said that since Saturday firefighters have responded to more than 550 calls, at least five times the usual for a 24- hour period.Levy said that while the two most dangerous fires so far – in Ma’asiyahu Prison and in Rosh Ha’ayin last night – were not caused by the weather, the public should avoid building bonfires altogether if possible.The plea was made despite it coinciding with Lag Ba’omer, which began on Saturday evening and is celebrated by lighting bonfires, typically by young people in parks. Levy called on those who do hold bonfires to make them as small as possible, not to leave them unattended and to make sure to extinguish them fully before leaving their sites.In Jerusalem, some 200 residents of Kfar Uriya were evacuated at 2 a.m. on Sunday after a forest fire spread from Lag Ba’omer celebrations near Beit Shemesh, according to Jerusalem Fire and Rescue Services spokesman Asaf Abras.“We received assistance from nearly 20 units from central and southern Israel to help us put it out, but it was difficult [to extinguish] due to the dry conditions,” said Abras. “We were finally able to allow residents to return safely to their homes Sunday morning at around 6 a.m.”Abras said wildfires also broke out in the Jerusalem Forest, Ramot, Har Nof and Moshav Beit Zayit, resulting in the destruction of roughly 2,000 dunams of vegetation.Additionally, a brush fire in East Talpiot resulted in nine vehicles in the UN building’s parking catching fire.“Over the last 24 hours we’ve been dealing with a lot of small and big fires because of people not being responsible while observing Lag Ba’omer near brush and forest,” Abras said.He added that although all the blazes have since been extinguished, firefighters have remained on call to ensure continued public safety during pos-tholiday celebrations. 319\n"

Dopo il via libera avuto dal prefetto di Sassari e del Genio Civile, Giovannelli ha disposto la demolizione del ponte che attraversa il Rio Siligheddu, che era stato distrutto dall'alluvione del novembre 2013 e ricostruito due mesi dopo. \"Un tappo\", l'ha definito il sindaco che due anni fa aveva sollevato delle perplessità nella ricostruzione del ponte, per la quale erano stati spesi 80 mila euro. Le ruspe ora stanno entrando in azione per demolirlo.Poco dopo le 16.30 il rio Siligheddu, già tracimato in mattinata nella zona di Isticadeddu, ha straripato anche nel quartiere Bandinu, il più colpito dall'alluvione di due anni fa. Stessa sorte per il rio San Nicola, che ha mandato sott'acqua via Galvani, e il rio Gadduresu, che ha invaso via Barcellona. Non si contano piu' le case allagate e le persone soccorse.Il Comune intanto ha reso noti i numeri di telefono di emergenza: per chiedere assistenza o un alloggio sostitutivo occorre chiamare il numero 0789 52184; per le persone con problemi motori e disabilità è operativo il numero 0789 52297.\"Immediata chiusura di tutti gli uffici pubblici non comunali\". Con una nuova ordinanza il sindaco di Olbia, Gianni Giovannelli, ha disposto per stasera e per la giornata di domani la chiusura al pubblico degli sportelli. Anche la Asl di Olbia ha esteso anche a domani il blocco delle attività ambulatoriali non urgenti e ha invitato la popolazione ad evitare le visite dei ricoverati negli ospedali di Olbia, Tempio Pausania e La Maddalena.Il presidente del Consiglio Matteo Renzi sta seguendo gli sviluppi della esondazione a Olbia, in contatto continuo e diretto con il capo del dipartimento della Protezione civile, Fabrizio Curcio, e con il presidente della regione Sardegna, Francesco Pigliaru. Lo riferiscono fonti di Palazzo Chigi.A causa delle abbondanti precipitazioni cominciate ieri pomeriggi alcune famiglie hanno dovuto lasciare le abitazioni. I primi sfollati, stanno affluendo nel centro di raccolta situato nelle scuole del rione Isticcadeddu. Da Cagliari sono partite due colonne mobili, inviate dalla Regione, in direzione Olbia. Attesi in città anche i militari della Brigata Sassari.La pioggia ha colpito in particolare le coste della Gallura, la Baronia e l'area di Cagliari, oltre che il Campidano e il Sulcis. Ma i disagi maggiori per i rovesci incessanti si sono avuti a Siniscola e a Torpé (Nuoro). In quest'ultimo paese, già colpito dalla precedente alluvione nel 2013, le precipitazioni hanno fatto saltare alcuni canali tombati nelle vie del centro. Così il sindaco Omar Cabras è dovuto intervenire con gli operai per scoperchiare il manto stradale e far defluire l'acqua che nel frattempo ha allagato le cantine di una decina di case nella parte bassa. Circa 35 famiglie sono state fatte evacuare già ieri pomeriggio.C'è una famiglia di quattro persone isolata a Torpé dopo il crollo in mattinata di un ponte, nella borgata di Villanova, zona alta del paese. Il ponte, a fianco del quale si è aperta una voragine, consentiva il collegamento dall'abitazione al paese. Il cedimento è avvenuto a seguito del completo allagamento del canale tombato di Preda 'e Janas. La famiglia è in salvo e viene assistita dagli uomini della Protezione civile e della Polizia municipale.Le precipitazioni mettono in ginocchio anche Arzachena, esattamente come due anni fa. E' esondato il rio Oddastru e le forze di polizia sono state costrette a chiudere la provinciale 14, in direzione di Luogosanto. Fuori dagli argini anche un affluente del Liscia, al confine tra Palau e Arzachena. Sorvegliato speciale il rio San Giovanni, al limite della capienza: per precauzione è stata chiusa la provinciale 125 che collega Arzachena a Olbia. Difficoltà, infine, inlocalità Cudacciolu per l'esondazione di un canale vicino.\"Abbiamo tutto il tempo di mettere a posto i danni provocati negli anni da una certa cultura speculativa, oggi il nostro compito è quello prima di tutto di mettere in sicurezza le persone\". Lo ha detto il presidente della Regione Sardegna, Francesco Pigliaru, nella conferenza stampa convocata per fare il punto sull'emergenza provocata dal ciclone. \"Tutti stanno lavorando per ridurre al minimo l'impatto per le persone a causa di queste emergenze, con le quali dobbiamo imparare a convivere\", ha aggiunto.Vista la situazione, la circolazione dei treni è bloccata in via precauzionale per il maltempo in Sardegna, che nelle prossime ore interesserà la parte settentrionale ed orientale dell'Isola. Rfi ha comunicato che dalle 15.20, la circolazione dei treni tra Olbia e Ozieri/Chilivani è stata sospesa. Per garantire la mobilità nella tratta è stato istituito un servizio sostitutivo con autobus.\"Il codice rosso per l'allerta meteorologica è stato declassato ad arancione per il sudSardegna e Medio Campidano, ma resta l'allerta rossa per il resto dell'isola almeno sino alle sei del mattino di domani. Rimane un rischio alto per le zone di Olbia e della Gallura, dove la situazione è difficile ma sotto controllo e i cittadini stanno collaborando con i sindaci dei Comuni interessati\". Lo hanno riferito il presidente della Regione Francesco Pigliaru e l'assessore all'Ambiente Donatella Spano in una conferenza stampa convocata nella sede della Protezione civile a Cagliari per un aggiornamento della situazione. Per domani l'allerta è prevista arancione per tutto il settentrione della Sardegna.Domani riapriranno le scuole a Cagliari e Carbonia, dopo che la Protezione civile regionale ha declassato l'allerta per rischio idrogeologico nel Sud della Sardegna. Riprenderanno anche le attività dell'università di Cagliari, sospese da ieri pomeriggio per precauzione. 322\n",
      "At least 4 people have died in Italy after two days of heavy rain caused floods and landslides in several regions across the country.  Meanwhile heavy rain in the Balkans has raised fears of a repeat of the devastating floods of May 2014.  As of yesterday, flooding had affected only a few areas in Croatia and Bosnia. However, river levels are expected to rise significantly after several days of heavy rain. Some areas received over 120 mm in a 24 hour period.  4 Killed in Italy  Storms and heavy rain have caused flooding and landslides in central and southern regions.  Italy’s civil protection agency say that 4 people have died in landslides and floods over the last 2 days. Two of the people died in the province of Aquila in the Abruzzo region, where around 50 people had to be evacuated after a river overflowed. Other fatalities have been reported in the province of Frosinone in Lazio region, and one in the province of Benevento, Campania region.  Flooding has also affected the provinces of Palermo, Messina and Trapani in Sicily.  ECHO said that on 14 October around 75 mm of rain fell in 24 hours in Pisa, Tuscany region and 135 mm in Venice.  Croatia  Croatian authorities have issued alerts for levels the Kupa and Vojlovica rivers. ECHO reported yesterday that “maximum water levels on Sava river are expected on 15th to 16th October in the Karlovac area and upriver of Crnac area. During the weekend the maximum water levels are expected in Sisak area (Kupa – Sava Basin). Next week the water wave will flow downriver from Sisak towards Jasenovac, Slavonski Brod and Županja”.  Some flooding has been reported in Croatia, according to local media. Parts of the city of Karlovac in central Croatia, were under water yesterday, 15 October, 2015, after the Kupa and Korana rivers overflowed.  Below is a map of the flooded area around Karlovac from Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) of the European Union. According to EMS, nearly 10,000 hectares have been flooded in the area, with almost 20 km of roads left under water and over 5,000 people affected..  For complete details and map, see the Copernicus map here.  Flooding has also been reported in the southern county of Sibenik-Knin county where several buildings and roads have been damaged. Coastal areas suffered some of the worst of the heavy rain.  Bosnia  Bosnia has seen some of the heaviest rainfall over the last 2 days. ECHO reported that 120 mm of rain fell in Mostar in 24 hours between 14 and 15 October.  Between 14 and 15 October, Livno saw 83.5 mm and Sanski Most 63.2 mm in 24 hours. Elsewhere, in the last 24 hours Ivan Sedlo saw 73.2 mm.  ECHO report that flooding has affected parts of Knezica in Kozarska Dubica municipality after rivers overflowed.  BIRN report that the river Una in north-western Bosnia rose nearly two metres in 24 hours between Wednesday and Thursday. Overflows from the Una and other rivers flooded dozens of houses and buildings in Prijedor, Novi Grad, Kozarska Dubica, Gradiska and Kostajnica.  Serbia and Romania  No flooding has been reported as yet in Serbia, although authorities there are preparing for increased levels of the Danube, Sava and Drina rivers.  Romanian authorities have also reported increased levels of rivers in the country, in particular the Lotru and the Sebes. Romania saw severe flooding earlier this week. Over 20 people had to be rescued from stranded vehicles after flash floods in Corbu on the Black Sea coast on Monday 12 October 2015. 323\n",

      "At least one person was dead and six were missing Monday as a strong typhoon whipped through the Tokyo metropolitan area after making landfall further south, bringing torrential rain and strong winds to the Kanto region.  Typhoon Phanfone, the 18th of the season, headed out to sea and was expected to weaken to an extratropical depression off Japan’s northern Pacific coast, the Meteorological Agency said.  A total of 39 people in 17 prefectures were injured, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency.  Police continued their search for two men who went missing due to mudslides in Yokohama and a junior high school boy who was swamped by waves in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture.  About 2.7 million people in eight prefectures were advised to evacuate, while more than 50,000 were given actual orders to leave. Among them were residents on Izu-Oshima Island, where heavy rains caused deadly mudslides in October last year.  The evacuation orders were lifted as of Monday night.  At 6 p.m., the typhoon was quickly moving east-northeast in the Pacific east of Japan, with an atmospheric pressure of 980 hectopascals at its center, according to the Meteorological Agency.  The typhoon triggered the cancelation of more than 600 flights and the suspension of about 100 runs on the Tokaido Shinkansen Line, affecting more than 100,000 people.  Commuter trains saw delays and suspensions as well, disrupting the morning rush hour.  The agency issued warnings for strong winds, mudslides and river flooding as the typhoon broke rainfall records in some areas.  The city of Shizuoka got 87 mm per hour in Aoi Ward, while Hiratsuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, got 72 mm — both local records.  In Shizuoka Prefecture, 267,000 households comprising 667,000 people had been urged to evacuate to safer ground as of 9:30 a.m., the prefectural government said.  In Toyohashi, Aichi Prefecture, more than 4,600 people were urged by authorities to flee to avoid river flooding.  The Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant, plagued by radiation-tainted water, was bracing to receive 50 mm of rain per hour. Tokyo Electric Power Co. halted work both on land and at sea, bundling cables and hoses and tying down heavy machinery.  “We are also patrolling and checking where water may flow in,” a Tepco spokesman said.  Meanwhile, the search for the bodies of at least 12 hikersbelieved to be lying on the still-smouldering Mount Ontake was suspended. Rescue workers have already been retrieved 51 bodies.  The volcano was packed with climbers during the surprise eruption on Sept. 27 — Japan’s deadliest in almost 90 years. Nearly 1,000 Self-Defense Forces personnel, firefighters and police were participating in a search made all the more treacherous by toxic gases still rising from the peak, as well as a knee-deep layer of sticky ash.  “We want to resume operations as soon as possible when weather permits,” said an official with the Nagano Prefecture crisis management office. Mount Ontake straddles Nagano and Gifu prefectures.  People living below the mountain were warned that the downpour could dislodge the layers of ash, causing mudslides. On Sunday, three U.S. airmen on Okinawa Island were washed away by the typhoon. One was found dead and the other two remain missing, according to the U.S. Air Force and the Japan Coast Guard.  The airmen were photographing the rough weather on the island’s northern coast when they were overcome by the waves, according to Tsuguyoshi Miyagi of the Coast Guard’s Okinawa branch.  The U.S. Air Force said the search had been interrupted by rough seas. Their names were being withheld pending notification of relatives.  “Three officials were taking pictures with high waves whipped up by the typhoon in the background,” a spokesman from the municipal police said early Monday.  A 21-year-old surfer also went missing in the waters off Fujisawa, Kanagawa Prefecture, a Coast Guard spokesman said.  Okinawa is home to about half of the roughly 50,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan.  Several people in Kyushu were injured by the typhoon as the storm grounded more than 100 flights Sunday and knocked out power to more than 9,500 homes.  In Suzuka, Mie Prefecture, a French driver was severely injured in an accident in the Japanese Grand Prix, which had to be shortened as the heavy rain made conditions too dangerous. Formula One driver Jules Bianchi of the Marussia team went off the track at a turn and hit a recovery vehicle that was removing a car that had crashed earlier.  An unconscious Bianchi was taken to a nearby hospital where he underwent emergency surgery for a severe head injury. Race officials said he was in critical condition.  Elsewhere in the Pacific, the 19th typhoon of the season whipped the Mariana Islands, including Guam, with high winds and heavy rain.  Typhoon Vongfong was expected to reach an area of the sea southeast of Okinawa around early Saturday.  In the Marianas, the eye of the typhoon skirted the small island of Rota. Power outages and minor flooding were reported in some areas Monday morning as damage reports started to arrive.  Rota has about 2,500 residents and many of its buildings made of concrete.  The weather service canceled a flash-flood watch for the islands around 8:30 a.m. Monday, as the storm shifted farther west. Light to moderate rain was expected to continue for several hours, with occasional downpours, but major flooding was not expected, the agency said. 329\n",
      "Japan is bracing for Typhoon \"Halong\" which is expected to make landfall in central Shikoku late Saturday or early Sunday, August 10, 2014. Halong already lashed large areas of southwestern Japan bringing heavy rain and strong winds grounding about 460 fights. About 140 000 residents of southern Japan have been advised to evacuate.  JMA warned of major landslides and floods mainly in western Japan. Population affected by Category 1 (120 km/h) wind speeds or higher is 2.7 million.  Special warning has been issued for Shikoku, which expects about 70 centimetres (28 inches) of rainfall, Kyushu, and the Kinki region of Japan's main island Honshu.  At 09:00 UTC today, Halong was located approximately 179 nautical miles (205 miles/331 km) southeast of Sasebo, Japan, and has tracked north-northeastward at 12 knots (13.8 mph/22.2 km/h) over the past six hours. Maximum significant wave height at 06:00 UTC today was 26 feet (7.9 meters).  At the same time Halong's maximum sustained winds were 70 knots (80.5 mph/129 km/h - Category 2 typhoon on Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale), wind gusts were 85 knots (97.8 mph/157.4 km/h).  Once it hits land in central Shikoku the typhoon is expected to rapidly weaken. It will pass most of Japan's territory over the weekend and reach its northwestern regions by Monday.

Image credit: UW CIMSS  Tropical Storm \"Halong\" rapidly intesified and became a Category 4 typhoon near the Marianas Islands, Northwestern Pacific, on August 2, 2014. It soon became the third Super-Typhoon of 2014 in the Western Pacific basin.  A man drowned in a raging river while more than half a million people were advised to evacuate as heavy rain from Typhoon Nakri lashed the country last weekend.  Typhoon \"Halong\" comes a month after Typhoon \"Neoguri\" killed several people and left a trail of destruction in southern Japan.  Update:  Halong was downgraded to a tropical storm as it approached southwest coast and made two landfalls over Shikoku Island and Hyogo prefecture in western Japan. One person died and more than 50 were injured.  JMA issued the highest alert for heavy rain in Mie prefecture in central Japan, prompting two towns to order about 570 000 residents to move away from swollen rivers. Another 600 000 people were advised to evacuate across the country.  Featured image: NASA Terra/MODIS acquired August 9, 2014. 330\n"

      "Typhoon Neoguri weakened to a tropical storm as it moved toward Japan’s southernmost main island of Kyushu after prompting the evacuation of almost 90,000 people amid threats of floods and landslides.  Neoguri was about 230 kilometers (143 miles) southwest of Sasebo, on Kyushu, with top winds reaching 111 kilometers (69 miles) per hour, the U.S. Navy Joint Typhoon Warning Center said in an advisory at 11 a.m. New York time. It would be classified as a tropical storm on the U.S. Saffir-Simpson scale.  “The weakening trend is expected to continue as sea surface temperatures decrease,” the center in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, said in a forecast analysis.  Neogrui, which was moving east-northeast as of 11:45 p.m. local time, left 20 injured yesterday in Okinawa, where it grounded flights and prompted evacuations. As it nears Kyusho, it will encounter more wind shear that will tear at its structure, and the island’s mountains will further weaken it.  Parts of Kyushu will probably be hit with violent winds, swollen rivers and waves up to 10 meters high, the Japan Meteorological Agency reported on its website. While rain will generally amount to 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) to 3 inches, some areas may get as much as 5 inches, leading to “localized flooding in higher terrain,” said Commodity Weather Group LLC.  “Winds will be down to 35 knots when it passes Tokyo about 24 hours later,” David Streit, a forecaster at Commodity Weather in Bethesda, Maryland, said in an e-mail received at 6:23 p.m. Tokyo time.  Evacuations Urged  Officials in the Kyushu city of Amakusa urged 87,327 residents today to take shelter in gyms and other centers as the storm threatened homes, public broadcaster NHK reported on its website.  Companies with Kyushu factories, including Nissan Motor Co. and Toshiba Corp., were monitoring the storm’s approach.  “We instructed factories and offices in Japan to take measures for safety against the approaching typhoon,” said Yu Takase, a spokeswoman for Toshiba, which has a chip factory in Kyushu’s Oita prefecture. “Right now, our factories are operating as usual.”  Nissan and Toyota Motor Corp. planned to decide on any countermeasures by this evening, the companies said.  Toyota and Nissan built 1.32 million vehicles at their four plants in Kyushu last year, Satomi Hamada, a production analyst for IHS Automotive, wrote in an e-mail.  Nissan’s two plants on the island accounted for 65 percent of the company’s domestic production last year, while Toyota’s portion was 18 percent.  Eastward Turn  The storm was expected to pivot east as Neoguri interacts with a low-pressure system over Manchuria, said Jim Andrews, a meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania. The low has created a vigorous westerly jet stream that will push the storm into Kyushu.’  Andrews said the remnants of Neoguri may hug Japan’s east coast. He said Tokyo itself will probably be spared the worst because it is sheltered by mountains to the south.  Japan Airlines Co. and its affiliates grounded 11 flights to and from southern Japan earlier, the company said in an e-mailed statement. The All Nippon Airways Co. group canceled 29 flights, affecting 2,000 passengers.  Refinery Halted  Nansei Sekiyu KK, a unit of Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA, halted refining and shipping operations at its 100,000 barrel-a-day Nishihara plant in Okinawa, the company said in an e-mailed statement.  Marine operations at JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp.’s 270,000-barrel-a-day Negishi refinery near Tokyo remained suspended because of high waves caused by the storm’s approach, according to a company official who asked not to be identified because of internal policy.  One serious injury in Okinawa was attributed to the storm, while 19 people suffered slight injuries, according to a statement from Japan’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency, which gave no other details.  The Mainichi newspaper reported that a man died yesterday after the fishing boat he was aboard capsized off the island of Shikoku farther northeast from the storm’s center, where the weather agency has a high-wave advisory in effect.  Japan has averaged more than 11 typhoons per year over a 30-year period ending in 2010, most of them occurring between July and October, according to the weather agency’s website. 331\n",

      "Officials in Japan confirmed an eighth fatality Wednesday in the wake of disastrous flooding unleashed by torrential rainfall that hit the eastern and northern parts of the country in the wake of Tropical Storm Etau earlier this month.  Fourteen of the 15 people reported missing in the Japanese city hardest-hit by last week's floods and landslides were reported safe and accounted for on Tuesday, and the 15th name on the list proved to be there in error, marking the end of the search and rescue effort in a region still reeling from the deaths and a heavy toll of material losses in the wake of Tropical Storm Etau.  The 15 people had been reported missing in Joso city, Ibaraki Prefecture, where a levee was breached by the swollen Kinugawa River as unprecedented rainfall struck parts of eastern and northern Japan last Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Public broadcaster NHK said one of the names on the list was the result of a \"telephone lie,\" but also cited experts who put forth other possible explanations for the mixup, which lasted only a few hours after the other 14 people had been reported alive and safe.  As the rescue effort ended, however, more than 2,700 people were still in evacuation shelters, their homes in varying states of disrepair as more rain moved in.  (MORE: Mount Aso Volcano Erupts in Western Japan)  Much of the devastation occurred in three prefectures – Tochigi and Ibaraki, neighboring prefectures in the northern part of the Greater Tokyo region; and Miyagi, a prefecture on the Pacific coast of northern Japan devastated by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.  The tally of homes flooded but not structurally damaged in last week's deluge exceeded that of the 2011 calamity, topping 18,000 in a government report Tuesday afternoon. However, the number of homes destroyed or structurally damaged in the disaster – 118 – pales in comparison to the catastrophe four and a half years ago, which destroyed 124,690 homes and damaged another 1,039,961 in what remains the world's costliest natural disaster of all time.  Here are the latest statistics from the Japanese government's Fire and Disaster Management Agency and other national and local governments as of Friday, Sept. 18:  The death toll is eight: three in Tochigi Prefecture, three in Ibaraki Prefecture, and two in Miyagi Prefecture.  There are 46 confirmed injuries, with Ibaraki Prefecture accounting for 24 of them.  A total of 18,882 dwellings have been confirmed flooded. Ibaraki leads this list as well, with 12,088 flooded homes.  In addition to the flooded homes, 16 dwellings have been destroyed and another 102 have structural damage.  Damage also occurred to 61 non-residential structures.  Damage to the agricultural, forestry and fishing industries has reached 11.7 billion yen (about 98 million U.S. dollars).  At least 455 landslides were reported – 358 of them in Tochigi Prefecture alone, and 312 of those in the city of Nikkō, according to the prefectural government.  Up to 26 inches of rain fell in eastern Japan Sunday through Friday due to Tropical Storm Etau and its remnant low.  Local officials in Ibaraki Prefecture said 1,344 people had been rescued via helicopter by the country's Self-Defence Force and rescuers from 10 of the country's 47 prefectures.  Key developments in the storm:  On Wednesday, Sept. 16, officials confimed the death of a 40-year-old man who had been out on his bicycle when the floods hit Ibaraki Prefecture on Sept. 10.  A 60-year-old man was found dead Saturday after the vehicle he was in was swept into a flooded river Friday morning in the city of Kurihara, Miyagi Prefecture. A 48-year-old woman also died in that incident.  Japanese media said a pair of eight-year-old boys were among those found alive and removed from the list of missing Saturday.  Two men, ages 71 and 51, were found dead in rice fields flooded by the levee breach in Joso, according to public broadcaster NHK. The men were not previously among the list of missing.  The Japanese government's Fire and Disaster Management Agency confirmed that a man found dead in a flooded vehicle in Tochigi Prefecture Sunday morning died of storm-related causes.  A 63-year-old woman was confirmed dead after a landslide struck Kanuma city, Tochigi Prefecture, early Thursday. The woman was missing for hours before being found dead Thursday evening.  A man in his 20s was confirmed dead Friday after falling into a flooded drainage pipe Thursday in Nikkō city, Tochigi Prefecture.  Rare emergency weather warnings were issued for Tochigi, Ibaraki and Miyagi prefectures on Thursday and Friday, but have all since been lowered.  A magnitude-5.2 earthquake struck Tokyo Bay at 5:49 a.m. local time Saturday, rattling the entire Tokyo region and prompting fears of quake-triggered landslides in rain-soaked hilly terrain.  The earthquake injured seven people in Tokyo and its suburbs, according to the FDMA.  Another earthquake, rated magnitude 4.6 and centered off the east coast of Ibaraki Prefecture, rattled the Joso flood zone nearly six hours later but with weaker ground shaking.  The Shibui River broke through a levee in Ōsaki city, Miyagi Prefecture, on Friday morning. At least 1,000 people were stranded in floodwaters, according to the newspaper Asahi Shimbun.  The Japan Meteorological Agency issued the maximum \"Level 5\" flood warning Friday for the Yoshida River in Miyagi Prefecture and for the Mogamiogumi River in Yamagata Prefecture.  More than 800 people in the mountainous town of Minamiaizu, Fukushima Prefecture, were cut off from the outside world due to flooding and landslides on the lone highway through town Friday.  The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a rare emergency heavy rainfall warning for Miyagi Prefecture and its 2.3 million residents early Friday as torrential rains continued to drench the prefecture, which includes the city of Sendai, raising concerns of landslides and river flooding. The JMA observation site near Sendai's central business district reported 269 millimeters (10.59 inches) of rain in the 24-hour period between 7:40 a.m. Thursday and 7:40 a.m. Friday local time. (Japan is 13 hours ahead of U.S. Eastern Daylight Time.) JMA lowered the warning for Miyagi Friday evening.  New pictures emerge of the worsening flood situation in eastern Japan @SkyNewsAust pic.twitter.com/tU8tt8LClY (@Amy_Greenbank) — SKY NEWS WEATHER (@SkyWeatherAUS) September 10, 2015  \"We can say this is an abnormal situation and there is imminent serious danger,\" said Takuya Deshimaru, chief forecaster at the Japan Meteorological Agency, according to the BBC.  On Thursday, JMA issued similar emergency weather warnings for 5 million people in Tochigi Prefecture and Ibaraki Prefecture, north and northeast of Tokyo, on Thursday morning. The warnings were issued as a band of heavy rainfall associated with the post-tropical remnant of Tropical Storm Etau stalled over eastern Japan, dumping up to 21 inches of rain in 24 hours near the head of the Kunigawa River, which drains south through the northern suburbs of Tokyo.  The emergency warnings in Tochigi and Ibaraki prefectures were lowered Friday morning.  Levee Break Unleashes Dangerous Flash Flood  Early Thursday afternoon, the Kinugawa River breached a levee in the city of Joso, Ibaraki Prefecture. Prefectural government officials there said 22 people were missing due to the flooding and hundreds of others were still awaiting rescue Friday morning, according to public broadcaster NHK. All of the missing have since been accounted for, but it took several days to rescue all of the stranded residents.  JMA had already issued its highest level of flood warning for the Kinugawa River Thursday morning before the breach occurred.  Japan's Self-Defense Force sent helicopters to the scene, plucking a number of people from rooftops and the top stories of homes near the stricken levee. Japanese television stations broadcast some of the dramatic scenes live as they happened during the early afternoon hours Thursday.  In one disturbing scene, two people were seen struggling to cling to the roof of what appeared to be a garage or shed as the structure began to crumble beneath them and collapse into the raging floodwaters. The television broadcast, streamed live on the website houdoukyoku.jp, quickly cut away from the images to show its in-studio anchors. The fate of the couple is not immediately clear.  The scenes played out again Friday morning, as SDF helicopters plucked more victims standing on rooftops underneath sunnier skies.  At least 7,000 homes damaged or destroyed in Ibaraki. pic.twitter.com/UKk7uDSIrx — Robert Speta (@robertspeta) September 10, 2015  Efforts continued by helicopter and by ground Saturday, even as an earthquake centered in Tokyo Bay rattled the flood zone with moderate ground shaking. More rescues took place Sunday, when two men were found dead in rice paddies – the first confirmed fatalities in the Joso levee breach incident.  By Monday, images broadcast on national television showed much of the built-up portion of Joso had dried out, but crews were still working to pump standing water from flooded rice fields back into the Kinugawa and its tributaries. Efforts to repair the compromised section of levee were also well underway.  Tochigi Prefecture: Landslides Turn Deadly  According to the Tochigi Prefecture government, a landslide early Thursday in the city of Kanuma left one person dead and another person injured. NHK says the body of the missing person, a 63-year-old woman, was found Thursday evening. The woman was later confirmed dead.  Kanuma reported 444 millimeters (17.48 inches) of rain in the 24-hour period ending at 6 a.m. local time Thursday; in records that began in 1976, this was more than double the city's previous 24-hour record of 212 mm (8.35 inches) set July 11, 2002.  The incident was one of 41 landslides reported by the prefectural government. One home each was damaged in two of the landslides, and 11 people were trapped but later rescued in another of the incidents. The government said five people were stranded in Nikkō due to flooding on a local river Wednesday night; firefighters rescued them around daybreak Thursday.  The rain was extraordinarily heavy in and around the city of Nikkō, a popular tourist destination in Tochigi Prefecture. JMA's observation side in that city's Imaichi district recorded 668.0 millimeters (26.30 inches) of rain Sunday through Thursday. Of that amount, 541 mm (21.30 inches) fell within a 24-hour period Wednesday and early Thursday. The nearby Ikari observation site in Nikkō city logged 551 mm (21.69 inches) of rain in the 24-hour period ending at 6:30 a.m. Thursday; that was the highest 24-hour rainfall total anywhere in Japan during the storm.  Those sites' 24-hour rainfall totals were the highest ever recorded since rainfall measurements began there in the late 1970s – and the 24-hour totals alone at both sites were greater than the previous 72-hour rainfall records for each location. The same is true of several other nearby sites – a sign of just how extreme the rainfall has been.  Evacuation Orders Lifted for Most Areas  Voluntary evacuations became mandatory in some locales as the rain continued and rivers rose. In all, about 192,000 people were ordered to evacuate at some point during the tropical storm and ensuing floods, according to the FDMA. At least 15,000 people remained under orders to stay out of flooded areas in and near the city of Joso as of Monday morning.  Most of the voluntary evacuation advisories, which covered 3.1 million people during various stages of the storm, had been lifted by Saturday evening. Fewer than 3,000 people were still under voluntary evacuations Monday morning, mostly in Joso.  Storm Impacts Wide Swath of Japan  Tropical Storm Etau affected many other areas of Japan prior to and during its landfall. Here's a wrap of its impacts Tuesday and Wednesday:  Tochigi Prefecture: Officials were investigating whether rainfall in advance of Etau's landfall contributed to a slope failure at a mine in Ashikaga on Tuesday afternoon. According to Tokyo television station TBS, a 20-year-old worker was buried alive and later died in the hospital.

According to Tokyo television station TBS, a 20-year-old worker was buried alive and later died in the hospital. Fukushima Prefecture: According to the Mainichi Shimbun, a national newspaper, heavy rainfall Wednesday caused contaminated water from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant site to run off into the Pacific Ocean for several hours early Wednesday. The newspaper said it was the seventh such incident this year at Fukushima Daiichi, which suffered a catastrophic meltdown after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. The Asahi Shimbun's Asia & Japan Watch website reported that 82 bags of radioactive grass and other materials, byproducts of decontamination efforts around Fukushima Daiichi, were swept into a river in Iitate, Fukushima Prefecture, on Friday. Most of the bags were either recovered or became stuck under obstacles downstream, and officials reported none of the bags had ruptured or spilled their contents.  Kanagawa Prefecture: More than 600,000 people in the city of Kawasaki were advised to evacuate during the height of the heavy rainfall, according to government reports. Nearby, the city of Yokohoma recorded a five-day rainfall total of 306.5 millimeters (12.07 inches).

Nearby, the city of Yokohoma recorded a five-day rainfall total of 306.5 millimeters (12.07 inches). Shizuoka Prefecture: Flash floods and landslides were reported Tuesday in the city of Hamamatsu, according to NHK. Sediment from one of the landslides overturned a car, slightly injuring a man in his 40s, NHK said. In addition, two people were slightly injured after falling in flooded roadways in the city. At least 49 locations in Hamamatsu reported road flooding, along with 35 in the neighboring city of Iwata. NHK also said a section of cliff 10 meters (33 feet) high and 10 meters wide crumbled behind houses in a Hamamatsu neighborhood. No injuries were reported. Hamamatsu reported 388.5 millimeters (15.30 inches) of rainfall in the 72-hour period ending at 9:20 a.m. Japan time Wednesday, according to JMA data. The national government said 19 landslides occurred in Shizuoka Prefecture as a result of Etau. The top rainfall total near Etau's landfall zone was 424.5 mm (16.71 inches) on Mount Amagi in Shizuoka Prefecture in the 72-hour period ending at 4:20 p.m. local time Wednesday. Two elderly men suffered minor injuries after falling in strong winds as Etau made landfall west of the prefecture.  Aichi Prefecture: NHK said an elderly woman suffered a serious leg injury after falling during strong winds in the city of Toyobashi on Wednesday morning. NHK said at least 27 flights were canceled in and out of Chubu Centrair Airport near Nagoya due to the tropical storm. Winds at Centrair gusted as high as 64 mph late Wednesday morning local time.  Mie Prefecture: Heavy rainfall caused at least one landslide in the city of Toba, which was also buffeted by strong winds as the center of Tropical Storm Etau passed just east of the prefecture Wednesday.  History of Tropical Storm Etau  Etau formed early Monday (Japan time) about 1,000 miles due south of Tokyo. It has been moving in a generally northward direction ever since. At 10:22 a.m. Japan time Wednesday (9:22 p.m. U.S. EDT Tuesday), the Japan Meteorological Agency announced that the center of Tropical Storm Etau had made landfall on the Chita Peninsula of Aichi Prefecture shortly after 10 a.m. local time. The landfall point was about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Nagoya, the center of Japan's third-largest metropolitan area.  Later Wednesday, the center emerged into the Sea of Japan. JMA said Etau became a post-tropical low-pressure center at 9 p.m. Japan time Wednesday.  As of late Wednesday evening, the top reported sustained wind on land was 22.8 meters per second (51.0 mph) at 9:47 p.m. local time at Cape Erimo on Japan's northernmost major island, Hokkaido. The top gust was 30.9 m/s (69.1 mph) at 5:03 a.m. local time Wednesday on the small island of Kozushima, about 100 miles south of Tokyo.  Tropical Storm Etau was known as \"Typhoon No. 18\" in Japan, where tropical cyclones are typically referred to by number rather than name, and \"typhoon\" is used for all systems of tropical-storm or higher strength.  The name \"Etau\" was also given to a tropical storm that drenched Japan in 2009, killing 28 people and flooding thousands of homes.

      "Around 1,000 people were evacuated from areas around the city of Almaty, Kazakhstan, after floods and mudflow swept through residential streets on 23 July 2015.  According to the committee of emergency situations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kazakhstan, high temperatures over the last few days have melted snow and caused a glacial lake to overflow, which in turn forced the Kargalinka River to overflow and sent mud and flood water racing downstream towards Almaty. Local media report that a dam on the Kargalinka River partially stopped the mudslide.  Districts on the outskirts of Almaty city, including Algabas and Alatau, have been worst affected. Authorities say that 1,036 people were evacuated from affected areas and accommodated in local schools. Six people were hospitalized and 78 were given medical assistance, according to the Сommittee for Emergency Situations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  A total of 127 houses suffered damage. Bridges, roads and power lines have also been damage. The latest reports from the emergency committee say that 3,000 people remain without electricity in the area, and work is ongoing to restore power supplies. A State of Emergency has since been declared in the city of Almaty.

The current flood situation in the Chitral district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, was, according to local officials, caused by a glacial lake outburst after unusually heavy rain fell on 15 and 16 July, and again on 19 July, 2015. At one point around 300,000 people were stranded by floods in the area.  The rapid melting of snow and glaciers due to higher temperatures between 01 and 15 July 2015 triggered mudflows in the Shugnan District in the eastern region of Gorno-Badakhshan, Tajikistan between 16 and 18 July 2015. 341\n",

      "| Updated Tue, December 1st 2015 at 00:00 GMT +3  The resettlement of 2007-2008 PEV victims, forest evictees and other Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) is set to cost the government over Sh4.48Billion.  The government has already spend over Sh15.4 Billion in resettlement of 173,809 households displaced from the 2007-08 post-election violence.  According to recommendations from National Consultative Coordination Committee on Internally Displaced Persons (NCCC) there are 98,327 households awaiting resettlement from government.  The victims comprise of 75,293 Households integrated IDPs, 2,127 Households- Kipkurere Forest Evictees, 357 Households-Sambalat landslide victims, 1, 000 Households- Mandera IDPs, 13,618 Households unprofiled IDPs and 5,932 Households un-profiled forest evictees.  The committee in its recommendations after a meeting chaired by Deputy President William Ruto in August 18 this year want the resettlement of 75,293 integrated IDPs to be finalized and chapter closed.  The committee wants the National administration to conduct fresh profiling of 2,127 households evicted from Kipkurere forest to weed out individuals how have since been resettled by government before finalizing the resettlement.  The committee also asked the government to re-profile Sambalat landslide IDPs alongside 13,618 IDPS in unprofiled camps and 5,932 forest evictees before being resettled.  The committee notes that the entire resettlement of IDPs will cost the government Sh4.48 Billion out of which the Committee has Sh2,323,820,147 available this financial year.  Treasury in the 2015-16 budget allocated Sh2,205,000,000 in a bid to finalise the exercise which has dragged for several years.  The Committee was forced to reduce an initial budget of Sh891million which was meant for construction of IDP houses in Government procured farms, profiling of IDPS and forest evictees among other activities in cost cutting measures which saved the government Sh425Million.  The resettlement excise will see each household receive Sh200,000 cash benefit from government to enable them purchase land with the government considering on using NYS to build houses for IDPs to reduce costs.  The Committee has asked the government to immediately release funds to 470 households who were displaced in Mandera and were recently paid Sh150,000 each.  According to the committee each household should be paid an additional Sh50,000 while the County government of Mandera is set to receive sh50 million to facilitate the resettlement of the IDPs.  The committee also wants the government to resettle all integrated IDPs together with forest evictees to allow the government issue a new policy declaration of future IDPs.  \"Once the current IDPs are assisted there is need to issue a policy declaration to bring the matter to closure to enable NCCC embark on new chapter on internal displacement,\" the Committee recommends.  The Committee comprises representatives from the Ministry of Devolution and Planning, Interior and National Coordination, National Treasury, Land, Housing and Urban Development, Attorney General's Office and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Other members include the Chairperson of the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, the Chairperson of the National Lands Commission, Non -State Actors, the Donor Community and representatives of the IDPs.

      "Dégâts de pluie à Kalemie, samedi 8/09/2012  Le bilan des pluies qui se sont abattues sur le territoire de Malemba Nkulu entre le 15 et le 17 janvier derniers a été revu à la hausse. Estimé d’abord à dix mille, le nombre des sans abris serait finalement de vingt-trois mille, a annoncé, vendredi 1er février, l’administrateur de ce territoire de la province du Katanga. Certains sinistrés s’abritent dans des habitations de fortune, d’autres vivent encore dans des églises ou sont logés dans des familles d’accueil. Selon l’administrateur du territoire, ces personnes vivent dans des conditions difficiles et ne reçoivent aucune assistance.  Au total, ce sont trois mille cent une maisons qui se seraient écroulées à Malemba Nkulu à la suite des pluies de janvier.  «Toutes les maisons dont je disposais se sont écroulées. Actuellement, je vis avec ma famille dans une bicoque qui suinte », témoigne un enseignant d’école primaire, indiquant avoir perdu tous ses documents :  « Pour enseigner, j’éprouve beaucoup de difficultés. Tout a été emporté par la pluie, le petit Larousse dont je disposais ainsi que mes livres ».  Les responsables de la société civile de Malemba Nkulu appellent à une aide urgente en faveur des sinistrés, réclamant notamment des bâches et des ustensiles de cuisine.  « Le besoin immédiat, c’est une assistance en bâches pour se construire des habitations », plaide un animateur de cette structure.  L’administrateur du territoire affirme être dépourvu des moyens conséquents pour venir en aide à ces vingt-trois mille sans abris. Mais il affirme mener quelques démarches auprès des ONG internationales et agences des Nations unies pour obtenir leur appui.  En outre, le ministre des Affaires humanitaires et sociales séjourne à Lubumbashi (Katanga) depuis le jeudi 31 janvier pour évaluer la situation humanitaire à Malemba Nkulu.  La pluie du 15 janvier avait également fait des victimes à Lubumbashi, la capitale provinciale, causant la mort d’une personne et emportant une vingtaine de maisons.

      "Reports coming out of North Korea say heavy rainfall has caused dozens of human casualties, destroyed homes and flooded farmland, the Associated Press reported Wednesday. According to AP, a dipstach from North Korea's Korean Central News Agency cited \"40 human casualties\" without elaborating. Similar reports on past damaging rains indicate the figure is the number of dead.  KCNA reported that flooding destroyed 1,070 houses and 99 public buildings such as schools and hospitals. The dispatch also said more than 300 acres of farmland have been flooded.  The heavy rains occurred as the remnants of Typhoon Goni passed by the Korean Peninsula overnight Tuesday. North Korea often suffers heavy damages from summer rains due to poor drainage, deforestation and dilapidated infrastructure.  Southwestern Japan took Typhoon Goni's best shot on Tuesday, as the storm damaged buildings, flooded streets and triggered landslides.  Goni made landfall in Japan about 6 a.m. local time Tuesday morning, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. The BBC said authorities ordered evacuations for more than 600,000 residents due to the threats from mudslides and flooding.  At least 70 people were injured in Japan, and one person is missing, BBC added.  The JMA issued a landslide warning for Fukuoka, the seventh-largest city in Japan with a population of about 1.5 million, shortly before 8 a.m. local time Tuesday morning. The warning said landslide danger was rising due to the heavy rainfall in the area. Several other municipalities in Fukuoka Prefecture, as well as parts of Saga and Ōita prefectures, were also under landslide warnings.

Flights to and from Kyushu were canceled, and bus service was halted.  One death has been attributed to high waves as the storm moved towards the mainland. According to NHK, a 66-year-old man drowned after falling from a fishing boat off of Miyazaki Prefecture on the southern island of Kyushu on Monday.  Wind gusts of 159 mph, a local record, flipped over cars and toppled utility poles overnight on the remote Japanese island of Ishigaki, near Taiwan, Japanese media reported. A few people were cut by broken windows. The storm, with maximum sustained winds of 112 mph, was heading north toward Japan's southernmost main island of Kyushu.  The Kyushu Electric Power Company said that more than 350,000 homes were without power just before the storm made landfall, mostly in Kagoshima Prefecture, where 26.4 percent of all customers have no service.  On the northern islands of the Philippines, Goni triggered mudslides and brought deadly damaging winds, killing at least 21 people and leaving 15 unaccounted for.  Landslides killed at least 13 people in the mountain province of Benguet, including four gold miners who were pulled out of a huge mudslide that buried three work camps. A dozen miners were missing and more than 100 policemen and fellow miners dug through the mud amid fading hope that survivors would be found, officials said.  Benguet Governor Nestor Fongwan said days of pounding rain and a swollen creek saturated a mountain slope, which cascaded down the gold-mining area at dawn Saturday. \"They were sleeping when a huge chunk of the mountain came down and buried their work sites,\" he said by phone.  Six people died elsewhere in the north, and four others were missing, according to the Office of Civil Defense.

      "THAILAND  In Thailand, since 17 September, a total of 7,962 villages in 191 districts of 29 provinces have been impacted by floods according to the Royal Thai Government’s National Disaster Management Office.  The latest Government update of 26 September stated that 9 people have died and over 2,100,000 people are reported to have been affected. Please note that this figure is based on the total population of the areas impacted and is not necessarily the actual number of people affected. As many as 6,900 houses; 176,000 hectares of farmland; 2,310 roads and 145 bridges have been damaged by the floodwaters. The situation in several provinces is already returning to normal. Given the current available data, it would appear that the situation falls very much within the national response capacity  LAO PDR  Between June and July, seven provinces in the north and central areas have been flooded after heavy rains swept across the country. Exacerbating the situation was the influence of Typhoons JEBI and Mongkhut that moved across northern in early August. Oudomxay, Bolikhamxay and Khammuan provinces were the worst affected provinces in terms of damage and loss. In Oudomxay, 17 people were killed on 20 August. Over 9,600 people in 30 villages were affected by the consequent flooding and landslides. Nearly 60 houses were destroyed and another 100 houses damaged.  More recently, four southern provinces - Champasak, Salavan, Attapeu and Xekong - have been flooded by heavy rainfall from a tropical depression that passed through the area late last week from southern China. Three persons were killed in Champasak, which is the worst hit province. Nearly 21,000 households were affected in the four provinces. The Government of Lao PDR is taking the lead in flood response and assessing the impact and needs of the affected population. Humanitarian agencies including UNICEF, WHO, Care International, Oxfam and World Vision, who have a presence in the field, are currently providing support to the local authorities.  VIET NAM  At least 24 people were killed and six missing when central and southern Viet Nam was hit by heavy rainfall and floods since early last week, according to CCFSC. Some 7,000 houses were inundated and more than 5,000 hectares of crops have been damaged, although much of the water has since receded. Early this month, there were 21 deaths as flash floods and landslides ravaged northern mountainous areas of the country. Last year, more than 260 people were killed in floods in Viet Nam.  CAMBODIA  Heavy rains over the last few weeks have resulted in floods in at least seven provinces throughout the north, and along the Mekong River, in central Cambodia. According to the latest Government figures, 21 deaths have been confirmed. 14,076 households (approximately 70,380 people) have been affected; with 2,508 households (approximately 12,540 people) evacuated. The Provincial Committees on Disaster Management (PCDMs), the Cambodian Red Cross (CRC) and other NGOs have been providing relief on the ground. Despite forecasts of decreasing water levels from the Mekong River Commission, the Government has issued a weather warning for heavy rainfall with the potential for flooding between 28 September and 1 October in the northern parts of the country. The Humanitarian Response Forum (HRF) is in constant contact with the National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM) and continues to monitor the situation and liaise with local and national authorities to assess changes in the context. 348\n"

Photo: UNRWA/Shafiq Fahed  25 August 2015  The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) called today for restraint in the wake of 24 August clashes between various armed groups that have seriously impacted the refugee community in southern Lebanon’s Ein el Hilweh Camp in Saida.  “We are deeply concerned over reports that civilians are endangered and that our installations have been directly affected by the fighting,” said UNRWA Spokesperson Chris Gunness in a statement. “UNRWA condemns any armed group that fails to respect its obligations under international law to protect civilians and to respect the inviolability of United Nations premises.”  With the possibility of some 3,000 people displaced, the UN agency has been unable to confirm fatality or casualty figures – but called for the prevention of further deterioration.  Mr. Gunness said that heavy fighting has been reported in the vicinity of a number of UNRWA installations, including schools and health clinics. Residents are reportedly vacating the camp and have taken refuge at various locations, mainly in Saida municipality and Mieh Mieh camp, but also elsewhere in Lebanon.  “UNRWA calls on all parties to respect the neutrality of the UN and its installations, to desist from conducting armed hostilities in residential areas and to allow its resumption of services,” he said.  The UN agency’s lack of full access to and movement in and around Ein el Hilweh camp restricts its ability to deliver essential services. However, UNRWA has mobilized its humanitarian response and, coordinating with partners, is helping to support displaced people – including by providing food, medical assistance and shelter.  “UNRWA will continue to monitor the situation as it evolves and provide assistance.” concluded Mr. Gunness. 354\n",

      "POINT DE PRESSE HEBDOMADAIRE DE LA MINUSMA- 13 août 2015  Porte-parole : Radhia Achouri  Sévaré  Comme vous savez la semaine dernière l’actualité a été dominée par l’attaque à Sévaré. La MINUSMA réitère sa ferme condamnation de l’attaque terroriste ignoble et déplore les pertes en vies humaines causées par cet acte criminel. MINUSMA présente ses condoléances au Gouvernement Malien et aux Forces Armées maliennes ainsi qu’aux gouvernements et aux familles des victimes parmi lesquelles elle compte des personnels associés de compagnies sous-traitantes de la MINUSMA. Elle souhaite un prompt rétablissement aux blessés.  Comme précédemment annoncé 4 personnels de la compagnie sous-traitante de la MINUSMA ont perdu la vie.  Suite à l’attaque, une délégation mixte, composée d’UNPOL et de la Force s’est rendue à Sévaré. La délégation comprenait aussi une équipe de chercheurs de l’unité de crime transnational organisé / contre-terrorisme (TOC/CT). Ces unités sont encore à Sévaré pour assister les MSF dans leur enquête.  De plus, le 11 août une délégation mixte comprenant des experts de la MINUSMA et de la Gendarmerie Malienne a visité hôtel Byblos pour chercher des restes d’explosifs, aucun matériel de ce genre n’a été trouvé sur le lieu.  Le 8 août le Commandant du Force et le Commissaire de la Police de la MINUSMA étaient à Sevaré où ils ont assisté à l’enterrement des soldats maliens qui ont perdu la vie suite à l’attaque terroriste. Pendant la visite ils ont présenté leurs condoléances au Ministre de Défense et ont loué les efforts des Forces Armées Maliennes.  Inondations à Ménaka  Suite aux dernières pluies enregistrées le weekend dernier dans la ville de Ménaka et ses environs, la marre de la ville située dans le quartier 3 a débordé et inondé des dizaines de maisons aux alentours. Cinq victimes sont à déplorer et plus de 400 personnes se sont retrouvées sans-abris. Des centaines de familles ont été évacuées par la MINUSMA et logées dans des écoles et bâtiments administratifs vides. Les FAMAs ont aussi évacué des familles dans leurs pickups.  Une forte délégation composée entre autres du Directeur de cabinet du Gouverneur de Gao, du Directeur régional de l’hydraulique et du chef du bureau de la MINUSMA s’est déplacée depuis Gao pour constater de visu la situation et apporter son assistance aux populations de Ménaka meurtries par l’inondation. Pour faire face à cette situation d’urgence, la MINUSMA a déployé des camions afin d’assurer le transport des victimes et de leurs biens. Il convient de noter que la visite du Directeur de cabinet du Gouverneur de Gao était la première visite d’un officiel d’Administration Gouvernementale à Ménaka depuis la crise de 2012.  Sur place, les Forces de MINUSMA et les Forces Armées maliennes s’associent pour aider efficacement les populations victimes de cette inondation.  La MINUSMA a mis à la disposition des autorités des camions pour assurer le transport des victimes vers des espaces aménagés, Elle a apporté un appui en eau minérale vu la pénurie d’eau potable dans la localité. Elle continue d’assurer le transport aérien du matériel, de l’aide humanitaire d’urgence et des autorités de Gao à Ménaka.  Sécurité  Le 10 août, un véhicule des Forces de Défense et de Sécurité Maliennes a heurté un engin explosif improvisé ou une mine aux environs de Tenenkou, région de Mopti. La MINUSMA condamne cet acte criminel et présente ses condoléances au Gouvernement Malien et aux Forces de Défense et de Sécurité Maliennes. La MINUSMA a assisté avec l’évacuation de (quatre) 4 soldats blessés dans l’incident. Les blessés ont été transportés par avion de la MINUSMA de Tenenkou à Sévaré et puis à l’hôpital Somino Dolo à Sévaré.  Le 11 Août des hommes armés non identifiés ont attaqué un camion contracté par la MINUSMA dans les environs d’Almoustarat, à approximativement 130 km au nord de Gao. Les assaillants ont tiré sur les pneus du camion et mis feu à la cabine, puis se sont enfuis. Aucune victime n’est à déplorer. Un détachement des FAMA a été déployé pour sécuriser le site de l’incident afin de permettre la réparation du camion.  Lutte anti-mines  Le service de lutte anti-mines de la MINUSMA coordonne le déploiement d’équipes d’éducation aux risques d’urgence en faveur des personnes déplacées à Tombouctou (Quartier d’Abaradjou), dans le cercle de Goundam (Bintagoungou) et dans le cercle de Gourma-Rharous (Gossi). Ces activités sont menées en réponse à un rapport d’évaluation du groupe de coordination sectoriel sur la protection suite à une mission menée en juillet dans la région de Tombouctou sur la situation des personnes déplacées. Plusieurs recommandations avaient été faites en rapport avec la menace posée par les restes d’explosifs de guerre.  Casques bleus  Les composantes militaire et de Police continuent leurs patrouilles de sécurisation dans les zones où elles sont déployées.  Le Commandant de la Force de la MINUSMA va entamer cette semaine une série de visites en Guinée – Conakry, au Togo et au Burkina Faso. Cette visite est dans la continuité de prise de contact qu’il a entrepris depuis sa prise de commandement avec la hiérarchie militaire des pays contributeurs de troupes.  Du 3 au 10 août, la MINUSMA et les Forces de sécurité maliennes (FAMa) d’une part, les forces françaises de Barkhane et les FAMa d’autre part, ont mené deux opérations distinctes de manière coordonnée, respectivement dénommées Opération Eglantine dans le cercle de Goundam et Opération Aneto sur le lac Faguibine (région de Tombouctou). Deux opérations séparées avec des entités dont le mandat est aussi différent : la MINUSMA étant chargée de contribuer à la protection des civils tandis que Barkhane et les Forces maliennes combattent le terrorisme. Ces opérations ont permis de couvrir au même instant un immense espace, assurant du coup la sécurité des populations. Un article compréhensif de la MINUSMA sur cette opération a été distribué hier à la presse et il est disponible sur notre site et page FB.  Genre et Protection des Femmes  Le 7 août, l’équipe Genre de la MINUSMA a animé une formation sur le thème « Genre et Opérations de Maintien de la Paix » à l’intention de 26 participants, stagiaires panafricains, de la Police et de la Gendarmerie provenant de 8 pays d’Afrique, dont 2 femmes. Cette formation s’inscrit dans le cadre d’un stage organisé par l’École de Maintien de la Paix « Alioune Blondin Beye » (EMPABB) à l’intention des futurs UNPOL. L’objectif est de renforcer les capacités des participants leur permettant d’acquérir une meilleure connaissance des concepts liés aux Opérations de Soutien à la Paix, de comprendre l’impact des conflits sur les femmes et les hommes, et de saisir les opportunités et les défis de l’égalité entre femmes et hommes dans la résolution des conflits.  En prélude aux prochaines élections communales, régionales et du District de Bamako, et dans le cadre de sa mission d’assurer la promotion de la participation politique des femmes au Mali, l’Unité Genre de la MINUSMA a eu une séance de travail avec des représentantes du Cadre de Concertation des Femmes des Partis politiques (CCFP) en vue d’organiser une journée d’échanges et de deux ateliers de formation en faveur des potentielles candidates à Bamako et à Tombouctou. Ces activités se dérouleront au cours de ce mois d’août pour mieux outiller 80 femmes de Bamako et Tombouctou qui souhaitent se présenter aux prochaines élections de 2015.  Projets à impact rapide (QIPs)  Le 7 août, à la Direction Régionale de la Jeunesse et des Sports de Tombouctou, les autorités régionales et la MINUSMA ont procédé au lancement officiel d’un QIP pour un meilleur accès aux équipements sportifs pour les jeunes de 5 Cercles de la région de Tombouctou. Sponsorisé par la Coordination Civilo-Militaire de la MINUSMA (CIMIC) avec un budget d’environ 13 000 USD, l’initiative contribuera à l’épanouissement physique des personnes concernées et aidera à promouvoir la cohésion sociale.  Affaires judiciaires et pénitentiaires  Du 4 au 6 aout 2015, la MINUSMA a participé à Tombouctou à une réunion de concertation avec les acteurs de la chaine pénale de cette région, avec la collaboration active de l’Ambassade des Pays-Bas. L’objet de la rencontre était de faire un plaidoyer sur la pertinence et l’opportunité de mettre en place un cadre de concertation des acteurs de la chaine pénale, à l’instar de ce qui se fait déjà à Bamako où une fois par semaine, à un niveau opérationnel, tous les acteurs de la chaine pénale (police judiciaire, magistrats debout et assis, administration pénitentiaire) échangent leurs informations, partagent leurs meilleures connaissances et pratiques, renforcent leurs synergies et perfectionnent la coordination des interventions depuis le mois de janvier 2014. Un cadre de concertation a été mis en place et devrait se réunir régulièrement pour échanger sur les problèmes liés à la chaine pénale et leur apporter les solutions le cas échéant.  Réforme du Secteur de la Sécurité et Désarmement, Démobilisation et Réinsertion (RSS-DDR)  La MINUSMA a accueilli la deuxième réunion du Groupe de travail technique sur la RSS-DDR le 10 août. La réunion a rassemblé les membres du Groupe de travail technique SSR-DDR comprenant les représentants de l’UA / MISAHEL, la CEDEAO, la Délégation de l’UE, l’EUCAP / Sahel, ‘Opération Barkhane, ainsi que les représentants des Ambassades du Danemark, de la France, des Pays-Bas, de la Suède, de la Suisse et des Etats-Unis. Le but de la réunion était de faire un point sur la mise en place du Comité de suivi de l’Accord (CSA) et de ses organes qui interviendront dans la Réforme du Secteur de Sécurité et le DDR ainsi que de mettre en œuvre ce mécanisme qui permettra de coordonner les acteurs de la RSS et du DDR dans leur soutien aux institutions de la République du Mali.  Activités prévues  Le chef de la composante Police (UNPOL) de la MINUSMA, Awale Abdounasir, va inaugurer un projet à impact rapide (QIP) au profit de l’Ecole de Gendarmerie malienne à Bamako le 14 août. Il s’agit de la construction des toilettes au profit du Personnel féminin afin de respecter le genre pour les femmes en stage ou en formation.  Dans le même temps, 17 agents de la Gendarmerie Nationale recevront leur certificat pour avoir suivi pendant huit semaines la formation des Formateurs. Pour marquer cet événement à double portée qui se tiendra le vendredi 14 août 2015 à 10h 00 à l’Ecole de la Gendarmerie de Bamako à Faladiè, les medias sont invités à participer à ladite cérémonie.

      "By Ika Koeck  Over the past several days, increasing heavy rains have caused severe flooding in the western state of Rakhine, Myanmar, destroying nearly 200 homes and causing serious damage to another hundred across four townships. During the first few days of the flooding, around 1,500 people were evacuated, and about 300 of the displaced continued to stay at camps for several days as the water receded.  “The figures are expected to increase in the coming days, as Red Cross assessment teams access remote areas of Rakhine affected by the flooding,” explains U Maung Maung Khin, head of disaster management for the Myanmar Red Cross Society.  Currently the Myanmar Red Cross is working alongside local authorities to assist affected communities. Red Cross volunteers are evacuating families to safety, distributing food and water, and first aid kits in Buthidaung township which include blankets, mosquito nets, basic kitchen utensils and other essential items. Further relief stocks will be distributed in the coming days in the township of Thandwe.  “The floods have triggered landslides in some areas. It impacts access to roads and bridges, so unfortunately it hinders our relief efforts, but we are also used to these challenges,” adds U Maung Maung Khin. “We will continue to do our best to those who are in need of help,” he says.  The Department of Meteorology and Hydrology of Myanmar has forecasted more rains in the coming days, which may prolong flooding in the affected areas.

      "MAKOLONGA/LINYANTI – Following heavy rainfall in the Zambezi Region the two constituencies of Sibbinda and Linyanti have experienced flooding for the first time in decades which has forced hundreds of people from their homes.  Villages in areas such as Makolonga, Mazoba, Sibbinda and Linyanti have been submerged by rainwaters for more than a week, with the situation said to be exacerbated by underground water that is spewing out from below the surface due to a fairly shallow water table.  At Mbozi village in the Makolonga area more than 15 households have been made homeless with a dozen having relocated to dry areas, while some have chosen to stay put to guard their possessions. Just a few kilometres further west 18 villages are reportedly affected with some homesteads having already succumbed to floodwaters and collapsed.  Some roads leading to villages have been completely cut off by the rainwater.  At Linyanti the interior of homes have been heavily flooded. Floors and furniture have been spoiled, plus food such as drought relief maize received by the villagers.  The Zambezi Regional Council Chairperson Raphael Mbala, who was accompanied by the Director of Planning Robert Mapenzi to assess the calamity first hand, described the situation as worrisome but confirmed the regional council is providing help to affected residents.  “We learnt about the problem last week that the two constituencies of Linyanti and Sibbinda are heavily affected following heavy rains. The regional council has already sent a team that is on the ground to make sure that tents are put up. We will also team up with the Red Cross and other stakeholders to make sure that there is safe drinking water and mosquito nets,” assured Mbala.  Sikosinyana Secondary School in the Sibbinda Constituency has been seriously affected and some teachers have also been forced to relocate. The flooding has left many residents in awe as many have only heard about previous flooding in the eastern parts of the Zambezi Region but not experienced it first hand. According to information obtained from locals the last time such heavy flooding occurred in Sibbinda was in 1978 and then again in 2006.  An induna in Linyanti village where 11 households are affected, Simon Chombo Mutimani, described the situation as “startling” saying he had never experienced such disaster since resettling in the area.  “It is the first time I experience this in our village. We are very much surprised,” said Mutimani.  Andrew Muyunda in the nearby village who was not home at the time of the flooding was equally alarmed, with some of his possessions having been completely destroyed by the rainwater.  “I was not at the village when the disaster occurred. When I arrived I found that my furniture had been washed away,” narrated Muyunda.  With the heavy rains continuing many more villages are feared to will face similar flooding, a situation that is likely to put a heavy burden on the regional council which is already busy with flood relief efforts in the regularly flood-prone areas of eastern Zambezi.

      "Complaints to ACC drop  BUSY YEAR: The director general of the ACC, Paulus Noa. Photo File  The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) investigated 172 of the 401 allegations of corruption referred to it during the financial year 2015/16.    It forwarded 29 cases to the prosecutor-general, of which 13 were prosecuted.    The number of complaints received by the ACC had decreased by 6% from the previous financial year.    The commission referred all non-corruption cases to other authorities and 184 cases were closed without investigation.    The ACC says cases are closed because there are no reasonable grounds for investigating, or the matter is non-jurisdictional, or the matter is the subject of an investigation by another body, or the complaint is frivolous or vexatious.    The extent of the fraud in the cases referred to the PG's office amounted to more than N$27 million. Other notable cases under investigation by the ACC during 2015/16 involved amounts totalling N$132 million.    One of these cases involved eight public servants from the Ministry of Health and Social Services who had conspired to channel close to N$5 million into a bank account to which they had access.    At the Henties Bay municipality three private persons submitted fraudulent claims of N$788 995 that were paid out by corrupt officials.    The ACC reported that a prisoner had orchestrated a criminal scam involving N$20 000 from police cells where he was detained.    Two public servants at the Oshikoto regional council attempted to embezzle N$20 million from a toilet-construction project.    An employee of the Hardap regional council working in the Schlip constituency was accused of having misappropriated N$62 446 collected for water and electricity.    The ACC also investigated and charged Namibians and a group of Angolans who had connived to submit fraudulent value-added tax refund claims to the value of N$114 million. The accused were charged under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act (POCA). The High Court has issued forfeiture orders totalling more than N$20 million against the accused.    There was also alleged corruption involving N$11 million at the former Polytechnic of Namibia, where forged documentation was used to allow students with outstanding debts to register.    A bribe of N$1 million was reportedly solicited at Unam for the awarding of a security contract.    A former employee at the Namibia Development Corporation was accused of fraud amounting to close to N$5 million.    The ACC forwarded documentation to the Asset Forfeiture Unit of the PG's office in order to restrain close to N$3 million that had been transferred into the bank account of an employee of August 26 Industries because the origin of the funds was suspicious.

      "The massive landslide that struck in the Nepal district of Sindhupalchowk on 01 August 2014 has blocked the Sunkoshi (Sun Kosi) river, creating a lake that some reports claim measures at least three kilometres by 300 metres.  The landslide buried dozens of homes and left over 150 people missing. Rescue teams including the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) are working in the area but initial reports say the chances of finding the victims alive are fading. Several villages situated along the river have been evacuated. Around 120 relief camps have been set up to accommodate the displaced.  The Sunkoshi hydropower project has been shut down as a result of the flooding. Two more power stations further downstream are also threatened. The whole area has been declared a “Flood Crisis Zone” by the Nepal government.  Nepalese military engineers, assisted by engineers from India, have been working in the area to try to unblock the river to find a way to allow safe controlled runoff of the water. So far 2 low intensity blasts have partially removed some of the landslide debris. The current plan appears to take a step-by-step approach so that the accumulated water is discharged slowly.  Threat of Floods in Bihar, India  In the Indian state of Bihar that borders Nepal, thousands are at risk of flooding from the blocked Sunkoshi river in Nepal. The Bihar Disaster Management Department (DMD) say that levels of the Kosi river are already increasing and fear the worst should the blockage break suddenly.  “If the entire blockage is blown away at one go and 25 lakh cusecs of water is discharged all of a sudden, it will bring a deluge in north Bihar,” the DMD Special Secretary said.  On Sunday 3 August 2014 the department ordered evacuations of at least 40,000 people in 9 districts situated along the Kosi river. Thousands still remain in the threatened areas and the Disaster Management Department say they aim to evacuate all of those under threat. The state will receive assistance from India’s National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).  2008 Bihar Floods  The current disaster comes almost exactly 6 years after the 2008 Bihar floods, when the Kosi river broke its banks near the Indo-Nepal border. The ensuing floods affected over 2 million people in Bihar, killing over 400.

The Whanganui River has burst its banks, flooding parts of the city and closing roads.  A Civil Defence state of emergency was declared yesterday after the region was lashed with rain.  Around 160 people have already been evacuated from their homes.  Radio New Zealand reported this morning the river had seeped through stopbanks overnight. The water level had dropped slightly since last night but a high tide is expected about 9am today.  Mayor Annette Main said most people had gone to stay with families and friends but there were emergency measures in place too.  \"The river has been high for quite a long time, so there's concern about the integrity of those banks with such a long period of flooding.  Inside Wanganui River Stream building owner Peter Hardy says it's minimal damage pic.twitter.com/fR0Rk1K5Vx — Daniel Faitaua (@DanielFaitaua) October 15, 2013  Army personnel from Wanganui and Linton spent last night sandbagging the stopbanks of the Whanganui River.  Civil Defence Controller Kevin Ross said they assisted with road cordons.  The Red Cross emergency response team and the rural fire crews also provided support.  Continued below.  Related Content Nasty weather hinders helicopter rescue Photo Flooding in the Wanganui Area Oct 2013 Another large storm to skirt New Zealand bringing giant waves  By 9pm yesterday 113 people had registered with the Civil Defence Welfare Centre and 18 people had been found temporary accommodation.  Wanganui residents were warned all flood waters should be considered contaminated after the sewerage system overflowed in some places.  Mr Ross said manhole covers lifted along Anzac Parade and the floodwater was contaminated with raw sewage.  Two state highways have been closed due to flooding.  State Highway 4 is closed between Raetihi and Whanganui, and police have said it was unlikely to open before 11am. Motorists should avoid the area.  State Highway 3 is also closed at the Whangaehu Bridge. Drivers travelling north must use State Highway 1.  Meanwhile, Ruapehu District Council chief executive and Civil Defence controller Peter Till said staff and contractors were busy clearing roads and assessing damage.  \"Ruapehu residents are, however, being asked to continue to drive to the conditions and take extreme care on the district's roads which sustained quite a bit of damage in areas.  More than 25 incidents were affecting roads in the region, including flooding, drop-outs, downed trees and slips - some of which would take some time to clear.  About 200 homes in the central and lower North Island are still without power following Monday's stormy weather.  Lines company Powerco said at the height of the outages, more than 20,000 properties in Wairarapa, Manawatu, Whanganui, Coromandel and South Taranaki were without electricity.  The majority of homes were back online, however about 200 properties still had no power.  Powerco network operations manager Phil Marsh said trees had caused the majority of the power cuts.  \"Many of the power cuts could have been avoided if people had contacted suitably qualified tree trimmers to have their trees cut or trimmed before they caused a problem.\"  \"Residents should contact their retailers and let them know if they are still waiting for the electricity to come back on. While crews are working to get everyone's supply back on it may be helpful to be pointed to individual properties.\"  - APNZ 401\n",
      "Homes were flooded across Tauranga city and Mount Maunganui, and heavy rain sparked evacuations. A woman had to be rescued from a stranded and partly submerged car.  There were 357 flooding related calls to the city council on Saturday 20 April, and 76 on Sunday 21 April.  In the catchment areas around Tauranga harbour there were many reports of stream blockages where fallen trees and branches were clogging up water ways. 402\n",

More than 400 people were evacuated from flood-hit homes in lower North Island towns across Taranaki, Horowhenua, Manawatu, Rangitikei and Whanganui over the weekend.  TELL US YOUR STORY OR SEND IN YOUR PICTURES TO OUR NEWSDESK  Flooding caused road and bridge closures, cut power to homes and forced people across the regions to spend the night in emergency accommodation or with friends and family.  The flooding, described as a one in 85-year event, is the worst ever recorded in Whanganui - worse even than the lower North Island flooding of 2004, which led to more than $140 million in insurance claim payouts.  Recovery from the flooding could take a month, Whanganui District Council told Radio New Zealand this morning.  \"The next step is to look at ways that we can support our isolated communities as well as help the communities in the urban area clean up,\" Cass Alexander, from the council's communications department, said.  \"So it's looking like it will be a recovery process over several weeks to a month for those people in rural areas.\"  Continued below.  Related Content Roads reopened following widespread flooding Video Raw: Wanganui's weekend of flooding North Island floods: Grandmother 'shoved to the ground by police'  Building assessments of affected properties will begin today, and the council said it would focus on the recovery for the region's rural areas. The council was also asking for anyone who was affected by the flooding to contact the council.  A Fire Service spokesman said there were no emergency calls about the flooding overnight.  All of the flooding call-outs were now being dealt with by local stations, he said.  \"It's just clean up efforts now really,\" he said.  The damage from the flood in Whanganui could reach tens of millions of dollars, civil defence controller Kevin Ross said.  He told Newstalk ZB there was still more than 400 Whanganui residents out of their homes today.  It was the city's worst flood in recorded history and the city was now in \"clean up mode\", he said.  \"We've estimated 400 out of their houses, that's the assessment we have to do today.  \"It's certainly the biggest flood we've ever had here and I've been here for some time,\" Mr Ross said.  Whanganui was no longer cut off from the rest of country with State Highway 3 open to the north and south, he said.  The flooding is the largest flood event ever recorded in the district, Whanganui Civil Defence said.  The situation was still being assessed, it said in its early morning update today. The focus today would be on identifying rural residents who have not been able to make contact with Civil Defence yet, and who may need assistance, it said.  The Whanganui River level was dropping in the urban area, so work has started on the clean-up operation.  Building inspectors would this morning begin assessing the worst affected urban properties for damage and possible contamination. Residents were warned to treat all flood waters, and areas that had been flooded, as contaminated.  Power has been restored to the Kai Iwi bores, the three major bores which supply the city, and the Westmere reservoirs were now refilling. However, residents were asked to continue to conserve water use.  Excavated areas remain cordoned off, Civil Defence said.  Police are providing mobile units around the city, while the Salvation Army is assisting at welfare centres and the Red Cross has started checking vulnerable residents.  People who were evacuated from their homes were asked not to return home until the property has been assessed and decontaminated if necessary.  Some areas are still without power, or are experiencing disruption to their power supply as repairs are carried out.  Power remained out at Ahu Ahu, Blueskin, Brunswick, Kai Iwi, Paparangi, Rangitatau East, Te Tuhi Junction and Westmere this morning.  It was expected to be restored to all those areas by 6pm.  The Peat St substation was flooded over the weekend but was back up and running by late last night.  Transpower had also been advised of pole issues in Roberts Ave, Civil Defence said.  There were a large number of slips on rural roads, Civil Defence said, while a number of urban roads were still affected by the flooding.  The Dublin Street Bridge is open to service vehicles only, and is unlikely to open to traffic before noon.  The City Bridge is closed until the approaches on both sides of the bridge can be checked and made safe.  \"The bridge itself has been assessed as structurally sound. A decision will then be made on whether the bridge can reopen.\"  This was also unlikely to happen before noon.  The Aramoho Rail Bridge walkway was closed.Access is available west and south on State Highway 3, but State Highway 4 (Parapara) is still closed.  Wanganui East residents can now access the city via a loop at the back of the eastern suburbs. The route is expected to be extremely congested this morning, and motorists are being warned to take extreme care and be patient.  At this stage there were no fears for lives, Whanganui mayor Annette Main said.  \"We haven't had calls from people who need immediate help, but we know that people are not able to get out of their homes in the rural areas,\" she said, speaking to Radio New Zealand this morning.  \"We know rural area people are resourceful and usually have supplies, but as days go by and people are unable to get out of their homes because of flood waters, or mostly because of the condition of the roads, then we know that we're going to be putting some other means of getting them out into place, and also getting supplies into them.\"  That would most likely be through the use of helicopters she said, as had been used in the past.  \"Some people are happy to stay, because they've got farms or businesses in the area that they need to keep operating, they've got stock, others are keener to come to town and stay in town while they can't get backwards and forwards to their homes.\"  The council would today try to make contact with those in rural areas who are cut off by damage to the roads, she said, \"some of which ... will take weeks if not months to repair\".  The army had also offered to help, Ms Main said, which she described as \"fantastic\".  \"We have the offer of the army for assistance where needed.\"  People in rural Whanganui might face a month away from their homes and livelihoods after the devastating flooding over the weekend.  Whanganui mayor Annette Main told Newstalk ZB there were \"major issues\" for rural areas.  Some of the roads alone would take months to rebuild and it would be a long time before Ms Main could get back into her own rural property, she said.  \"This is not going to be a quick fix for us,\"  \"I have an apartment in town...I'm ok there but there are many people in the rural area who won't be able to get in and out,\" she said.  The mayor told TV3's Paul Henry programme the extent of the damage could be devastating for some residents who relied on rural land for their income.  The damage was worse than the city had ever seen before, she said.  \"People have been through this kind of event before but there will be people whose lives are completely turned upside down staying with friends, wondering what's going to happen.  \"Many of those rural people and farming or running rural businesses, tourism businesses...there's a lot of work going on there that you can't just up and leave. \"  Civil defence would make contact with rural residents today and ensure they were safe.  Briefings are being held this morning to determine the status of the flooding in Whanganui, Rangitikei and Taranaki.  States of local emergency remained in place overnight for the regions after hundreds of people were evacuated due to severe flooding on the weekend.  Civil Defence warned people in all flood-affected areas to stay away from beaches, rivers and streams because of potential contamination.  Whanganui was cut off from the rest of the country due to thousands of large slips but State Highway 3 to the north and south of the city was now open.  In Rangitikei, dozens of people had to be evacuated from the beach community of Koitiata.  A number of Waitotara homes in Taranaki also had to be evacuated after the Waitotara River burst its banks.  In Manawatu, water contamination was expected due to power loss to sewage pumps.  Meanwhile, there had been reports of people who were evacuated from their homes in the Waitotara area being forced to sleep in their cars on Saturday night because emergency accommodation was full, Radio New Zealand reported.  \"They came and got us and evacuated us, told us there was accommodation up in Waverley, but it was all full up, so we slept in our car,\" one resident said.  South Taranaki Mayor Ross Dunlop said there was some confusion caused by the centre first being open at 4pm, closed at 6pm, and then reopening again when the seriousness of the situation became clear.  \"There was enough accommodation for people if they needed it, so I was surprised to hear that some people had stayed the night in their cars,\" he told RNZ.  Other residents were angry at the way they were evacuated from their homes, with one man claiming his grandmother was handcuffed and thrown to the ground by police.  \"Police .... said everyone's getting out, so they grabbed my grandmother and they arrested her,\" he said.  \"They were throwing her around. They just treated all the old people with disrespect.\"  His 67-year-old grandmother wasn't ready to leave because her house was unlocked, he said.\"  She was saying she wasn't going to go because she's still got her livestock to look after, and the fact that her house wasn't locked up, we still had things to move. They threw her up against the bus .. then they chucked her on the ground. I watched them do that.\"  Police confirmed to the broadcaster the woman was handcuffed, but couldn't comment on how she was treated during the process.  A tough weekend for residents  The heartbreak for many residents began after the Whanganui River breached its banks about midnight on Saturday, spilling floodwaters into central Whanganui.  The river then continued to rise to record-breaking levels, with the regional council recording a massive flow of 4740cu m per second at the town bridge at 3am yesterday - higher than the previous record of 4680cu m in 1904. The level peaked at 9.1m, significantly higher than the 7m peak the river usually reaches, even at very high spring tides.  Gene Toyne and husband Chris, who live in a low-lying area near Whanganui Airport, left their property on Saturday afternoon.  Mrs Toyne said they had woken early that morning to find floodwaters lapping around their house, and did all they could to safeguard their property.  \"We sat down for a cup of coffee around 1.30pm, because we hadn't stopped all day, and in less than half an hour the water was coming through the floor.\"  The couple had just enough time to grab some clothes, some wine and their two dogs and waded out through waist-deep water.  Mrs Toyne said she hoped to return to the house soon, but was \"dreading\" the condition she might find it in.  Whanganui Mayor Annette Main said things were \"dire\" yesterday morning and floodwaters were higher than anyone had seen before. Two evacuation centres had been opened in Whanganui and about 200 people had been processed there.  Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye visited the flood-stricken city yesterday and promised the Government would contribute to the cost of repairing flood damage.  She saw the damage at Anzac Parade and in the central city shopping area, before heading to nearby flooded regions. Ms Kaye was due to return to Wellington this morning, ready to brief the Cabinet.  States of local emergency remained in place last night for Whanganui, Rangitikei and Taranaki.  Civil Defence warned people in all flood-affected areas to stay away from beaches, rivers and streams because of potential contamination due to the heavy rain and flooding.  In Manawatu, water contamination was expected due to power loss to sewage pumps.  In Taranaki, a number of homes in Waitotara had to be evacuated after the Waitotara River burst its banks.  Kim Lewis, who lives on the Whanganui side of the river, said fire crews visited her at 11pm on Saturday with an evacuation order. However, she chose to stay at home to take care of her livestock and her dogs.  In Rangitikei, dozens more people had to be evacuated from the beach community of Koitiata.  Rangitikei Mayor Andy Watson said people were \"scared\" as the floodwaters rose on Saturday night.  \"You have people in houses, it's dark, the water is suddenly rising and they don't know where it's going to stop so they're frightened.\"  The Club Hotel in Marton was \"bursting at the seams\" with evacuees and stranded travellers on Saturday night, said owner Sandy Beaman.  \"Some people were a bit downhearted because it turns out they didn't have any domestic insurance cover. But that's just one of those life things, isn't it?\"  A number of highways remained closed last night, including parts of State Highway 3, which were closed yesterday due to slips and flooding. SH1 had been closed between Bulls and Hunterville but was reopened last night. Transport authorities warned drivers to take care.  Cold arrives for darkest days of year  Icy temperatures and severe frosts will replace the heavy rain that caused flooding chaos over the weekend.  Rain will continue to fall across the lower North Island today, but it won't be as heavy as the rainfall which led to the rapidly rising floodwaters.  \"The good news is things are looking much more settled over the next couple of days,\" MetService meteorologist John Law told Radio New Zealand.  \"We've still got showers for today, but nowhere near as much rainfall as we've seen over the last few days.\"  However, temperatures were likely to fall over the next few days, bringing a cold blast across the country, particularly in the South Island.  Mr Law said an area of low pressure had produced \"an awful lot of rain in very small spots\" across the lower North Island over the weekend, leading to the widespread flooding.  \"It was all blocked by a large area of high pressure to the north, and that cold air we had down south as well.\"  MetService meteorologist Emma Blades warned temperatures are set to drop.  \"Temperatures will drop across the whole country over the next couple of days, with severe frosts forecast for sheltered places.  \"Add the wind chill factor from strong winds in the east and it's going to start to feel bitterly cold for some.\"  Ms Blades said night temperatures in Timaru could drop to around -9C the week. The town's average minimum temperature was 0C for this time of year.  Heavy snow is expected in southern Fiordland, Southland, and southern parts of Otago, including Clutha and Dunedin.  Areas around the Canterbury Plains north of Ashburton were likely to get snow near to sea level, she said.  The strong southerly flow would also bring heavy swells to exposed coasts over the next couple of days before easing.  Large swells could persist around Hawkes Bay and Gisborne until the end of the week.  WeatherWatch was anticipating severe frosts, with analyst Philip Duncan saying cold rather than snow would be the main focus this week.  \"Last week ended warm for many - this week will not be the same. Welcome to winter - and to the start of the coldest, darkest eight weeks of the year.\"  Road closures  Several parts of central Whanganui city remain cordoned off as no-go zones.

      "A devastating flood which destroyed over 200 houses in Onuebonyi Inyimagu, Abakaliki and Izzi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State has reportedly led to the death of about two persons. The flood came as a result of a three-day downpour, which submerged houses as well as destroyed property and economic trees, while many families were also displaced.  Eyewitness account has it that the flood was induced by an overflow of Ebonyi River into Izzi River in which several communities were affected and foodstuffs, farmlands with household property worth millions of naira destroyed.  According to one of those affected, Okoroafor Nwenyim, the flood pulled down his house, rendering him and other residents homeless. He described the incident as the worst in the area.  Meanwhile, victims of the flood have appealed to the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) to come to their rescue with temporary accommodation. Also, they urged that Ebonyi River should be dredged to avoid a repeat of the tragedy.  Narrating their ordeal, another victim said: “I noticed water entering our house around 3a.m. I thought it was not much, until it submerged the whole house. We could not salvage anything from the house. We slept outside because we had nowhere to go. We appeal to the state government to come to our aid because in my case, I don’t know where to go with my children.”  Another victim identified as Mrs Agnes Ozigbo lamented: “It was a terrible experience. What we discovered was that the water from Ebonyi River overflowed its bank, thereby causing devastating flood around this area.

      "Flooding caused by ongoing heavy rains across southern Nigeria caused at least 15 fatalities in the last week of June 2014.  Heavy rains on 28 and 29 June affected Oyo State in southwestern Nigeria, where at least ten people drowned when a makeshift bridge in the Apete area of Ibadan suddenly collapsed into floodwaters. Several people were rescued from the overflowing river by onlookers. The original bridge linking the Ijokodo community to the Apete area collapsed during flooding in August 2011 and a temporary bridge was erected in the interim. Following last week’s drownings resulting from the collapse of the wooden pillars supporting the temporary bridge, street protests were held by locals angry at the slow pace of reconstruction.  Prof. Joseph Olowofela, Caretaker Chairman of Ido Local Government, described the incident as unfortunate, adding that the state government is funding the contract to construct a new bridge, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2014.  Another five people, including three children, have died in flooding near the Olodo River. They were sheltering in a church building when it was submerged by floodwaters. It was reported on 30 June that one body had been recovered so far.  Meanwhile, in Calabar, capital of Cross Rivers State in the southeast of Nigeria, last week’s heavy rains and resulting flooding are reported to have caused the collapse of 60 homes and public facilities in the areas of Ikot Ansa, Ikot Eneobong, Ikot Nkebre and Big Qua Town, as well as parts of Calabar South.  The Deputy Director of Information of the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, David Akate, said in a statement that the flooding was “attributed to the blockage of drains and other water ways as well as the construction of buildings along flood-prone areas.”  The statement quoted SEMA Director-General Vincent Aquah as advising motorists to stay clear of flooded roads and warning parents not to allow children to play around flooded drainage infrastructure and areas of ponding water, and exhorting residents to adhere to the campaign against indiscriminate waste disposal.

      "Severe flooding has been reported in parts of southern Norway after heavy rain brought by storm Synne between 04 and 06 December 2015. Maudal in Gjesdal, Rogaland saw just under 300 mm of rain in 3 days.  No injuries or deaths have been reported. However the flooding has caused some damage to roads, bridges and homes in Rogaland, Aust-Agder and Vest-Agder counties. Around 100 families had to be evacuated from their homes in Eigersund, Rogaland county. Norway’s state broadcaster, NRK, reports that around 30 farms have also been severely hit, suffering major damage.  The rain has now stopped but river levels remain high. Authorities in Sweden also report high river levels in western parts of Götaland and nothern part of Halland.  Parts of southern Norway saw flooding earlier this year after 97 mm of rain fell in Melsom during a 24 hour period between 01 and 02 September 2015.  The last major floods to hit Norway were in October last year when rivers overflowed in the counties of Sogn og Fjordane and Hordaland.  Sweden saw severe flooding just a few months ago when 97 mm of rain fell in 24 hours between 05 and 06 September in Hjortkvarn, Örebro County.

      "IDPs are mainly concentrated in the country’s north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) (up to 1.5 million), but also live in Balochistan province and other parts of Pakistan (up to 275,000). Numbers likely underestimate the scale of displacement as they exclude unregistered IDPs living in KP and FATA and IDPs living in other parts of Pakistan, including in urban centres such as Karachi.  The estimate is based on a combination of sources. For KP and FATA, UNHCR regularly publishes information on numbers of displaced families who are registered as such, based on data provided by provincial authorities (UNHCR, KP and FATA IDP Statistics as of 31 March 2015, on file with IDMC). To calculate the number of individuals displaced, IDMC uses an average family size of 5.2.  No one regularly monitors internal displacement in Balochistan, and IDMC’s estimate is based on information available from media sources (The News, 28 July 2010; ICG, 23 January 2014, p.14; IRIN, 13 February 2014).  IDMC’s estimate of the total number of IDPs likely underestimates the real situation. It does not include IDPs in KP and FATA who are not registered as such. People who become displaced but do not hold a computerised national identity card (CNIC), have two addresses, or whose CNIC contains faulty information such as a duplicate family number are not eligible to register as IDPs. Further, only those IDPs whose home areas the government has declared to be “calamity-hit” are registered as IDPs (OCHA, 7 August 2014, p.7; OCHA, 18 June 2014, p.1).  The Internally Displaced Person Vulnerability Assessment & Profiling (IVAP), an independent project set up in 2010 to profile IDPs, recently found that about half of the IDPs covered by its profiling in KP and FATA were not registered (IDMC interview, January 2015). Further, no information is available on IDPs from KP and FATA who live in other areas of the country, including urban areas.  In KP and FATA, the majority of IDPs live with host communities, and just over 42,400 people are in camps. Available data disaggregated by age and gender suggests that 31 per cent are boys and 23 per cent girls, while 21 and 22 per cent are adult men and women under the age of 60, respectively. 2 and 1 per cent are older men and women (UNHCR, KP and FATA IDP Statistics as of 31 March 2015, on file with IDMC). No disaggregated data was available for IDPs elsewhere in Pakistan.  The country has also experienced large-scale displacement as a result of disasters brought on by natural hazards, mainly floods. From 2008 to 2013 disasters displaced a total of 13.76 million people, placing Pakistan fourth worldwide in absolute terms. Relative to its population it ranked sixth, with almost 13,000 people per million inhabitants displaced (IDMC, 17 September 2014, pp.32-33).  Conflict-related displacement since 2004 has been caused by fighting between the Pakistani military and non-state armed groups (NSAGs), clashes between NSAGs, sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims, tribal and local clashes over resources, and human rights abuses committed by both the military and NSAGs (IDMC, 12 June 2013, pp.3, 5; IDMC, 10 January 2012, pp.3, 8; The Friday Times, March 2012; HRCP, March 2013, p.279; IDMC, 6 September 2010, pp.21-24; AI, 2012; AI, June 2010, pp.11-15; ICG, 23 June 2014, pp.13-15; BBC, 22 February 2014; IRIN, 13 February 2014; Reuters, 21 May 2014). Information on numbers of IDPs in FATA and KP is regularly updated, while numbers on Balochistan are scarcer.  Of the total number, up to 907,000 were newly displaced in 2014, all of them from FATA’s North Waziristan and Khyber agencies. This compares to 140,000; 412,000; 190,000; 400,000 and 3 million newly displaced in the five preceding years. The total number of people in displacement peaked at 3 million in 2009 (IDMC, 14 May 2014, p.74; IDMC, 29 April 2013, p.70; IDMC, 2 April 2012, p.90; IDMC, 1 March 2011, p.92; IDMC, 1 May 2010, p.82). Some of the current IDPs were displaced as early as 2005 (from Balochistan) or 2007 (from KP’s Hangu district) (IRIN, 13 February 2014; IDMC interview, October 2014).  At least 104,000 returned in 2014, including up to 46,000 registered IDPs in KP and FATA, 55,000 newly displaced from FATA’s North Waziristan agency in January and March 2014 who were not registered as IDPs, and more than 3,161 IDPs from Balochistan (UNHCR Returns Fact Sheet as of 31 December 2014, on file with IDMC; OCHA, 18 June 2014, p.1; IRIN, 13 February 2014).

      "Gaza  The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza, has declared an Emergency in Gaza City, following extreme weather and severe flooding over the past 48 hours. No casualties or injuries have been reported, however hundreds of residents in the flooded areas around the Sheikh Radwan storm water lagoon have evacuated their homes. One UNRWA school and an UNRWA Collective Centre in Gaza City have been affected by the rising waters.  The Agency has established an Area Emergency Operations room in Gaza City following contingency planning undertaken last week. As the largest UN agency in the Gaza Strip, UNRWA utilizes its procurement and logistical capacity to supply emergency fuel to municipalities, water, sanitation and health facilities, partially through the WASH and Health clusters (led by UNICEF and WHO). Today, UNRWA provided 60,000 litres emergency fuel supplies to run back-up generators of pumping stations and portable pumps. UNRWA is also prepared to provide adequate shelter to internally displaced refugees and non refugees should there be a need.  Gaza City is one of five areas in the Gaza Strip, a coastal enclave where UNRWA serves some 1.3 million Palestine refugees across all Areas. Of the 18 UNRWA Collective Centres, 5 are in Gaza City and currently provide adequate shelter for some 7,000 people displaced by the recent and devastating conflict.  As a precautionary measure, 63 schools in Gaza City are closed today for the afternoon shift, affecting almost 65,000 students. Forty-three schools in the North Area of the Strip are also now closed. Other UNRWA installations are still being assessed, though no damage has yet been reported.  UNRWA is in close consultation with all of its partners, the Palestinian Government and the local municipality who are monitoring the level of rain across the Strip.  \"We are very concerned about such severe storms this early in the season and on the back of unprecedented damage and destruction caused by the recent conflict,” said UNRWA’s Director of Operations Robert Turner in Gaza. “We are particularly concerned for those families still seeking adequate shelter and preparing for the winter months, and for the impact the flooding is already having on children unable to attend school.”  The devastation that extreme weather can cause is not new for Palestinian families in Gaza. In December 2013, the fiercest winter storm the region has seen for many years, Alexa, hit the Strip, and brought torrential rains and widespread flooding that displaced thousands. Such devastation exacerbates the already poor humanitarian situation for refugees and non-refugees in Gaza, which is dealing with the aftermath of a recent conflict, and an acute fuel and energy crisis.  UNRWA continues to closely monitor the situation. 431\n",

It threatens both coastal populations and important economic centers, including provincial capitals and economic. In the hinterland areas, climate change-related inland flooding is the most pressing hazard with the largest potential for widespread damage. The lack of water impoundments and/or water reticulation schemes serves to increase the vulnerability of the largely agrarian communities.  Sources: Post Courier PNG; EMTV; UNDP 443\n",

      "Port Moresby (ICRC) – The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Papua New Guinea Red Cross Society today began distributing household materials, construction tools and hygiene items to 2,000 people displaced by clan fighting in Sugu Valley, Kagua Erave District, Southern Highlands Province.  Recent inter-communal violence in the Kagua-Erave area has left at least 40 people dead and 30 wounded.  The aid distributed today will help ensure the displaced families are able to meet their basic needs. \"Our people have been desperate for assistance,\" said Justin Mapi, a leader of one of the displaced clans. \"This is the only help we have received since the fighting began. We have lost everything.\"  Following an outbreak of violence between the Wambea and Kombia clans in late 2013, the ICRC donated medical supplies to Kagua Health Centre and Sumbura Aid Post, as well as directly to the clans, to help treat the wounded. The ICRC also took one woman wounded in a grenade attack to Mount Hagen Provincial Hospital.  \"We are particularly concerned about access to health-care facilities for people injured in clan fighting across the Highlands,\" said Gauthier Lefèvre, head of the ICRC’s mission in Papua New Guinea. \"Many wounded people are afraid to travel to health centres for fear of attack by enemy fighters. A number of health centres in the area have been destroyed or abandoned after years of fighting, and appropriate care is often only available in provincial capitals far removed from the site of clashes.\"  The ICRC has been working in Kagua Erave District in partnership with the Papua New Guinea Red Cross since 2011, helping communities affected by clan fighting. In November 2013, the ICRC distributed construction and gardening tools to 749 families from the Apopa and Pawayamo clans to help them return to their lands after making peace. It held three first-aid training courses for communities and local police in affected areas throughout 2013. In neighbouring Uma village, the ICRC is helping build a health post to serve the community of Aiya LLG, which has been without any treatment facility since 2005.  The ICRC mission in Papua New Guinea has been operating since 2007. It focuses on promoting knowledge of, and respect for, international humanitarian law and international human rights law among the national authorities and the disciplined forces (Defence Force, Royal Constabulary and Correctional Service), and supporting the activities of the national Red Cross society.

      "IDMC’s estimate is based on figures collected among various stakeholders met during a mission to PNG in October 2014, including the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), local authorities, provincial disaster management representatives and a relocation project coordinator. Other sources include Amnesty International (AI) and the media.    The number of people newly displaced by conflict in 2014 is unknown. According to data gathered by IOM between October 2013 and June 2014, a total of 1,800 people were displaced in 7 conflict-related incidents while 14 disasters displaced some 17,000 people (IOM, on file with IDMC, 6 August 2014). IOM collected its figures based on its Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) methodology (IDMC interviews, October 2014).  Conflict-related displacement  IDMC’s estimate of 7,500 IDPs includes 4,000 people displaced by ethnic clashes in May 2010 in Bulolo district, Morobe province and who have since remained living in a camp in Bulolo town. Another 300 people, displaced in September 2013, also by ethnic clashes have since been living in an informal settlement close to the Bulolo river. The sources for these two figures are the Bulolo IDP camp coordinator and a representative of the Morobe provincial disaster office (IDMC mission, October 2014; PNG Loop, 27 December 2013)).  In Kagua Erave district, Southern Highlands Province, some 2,000 people forced to flee their homes at the end of 2013 due to ethnic clashes remained displaced with host families. The source for this estimate is ICRC who has been assisting the IDPs since their displacement (IDMC interviews, October 2014; ICRC, 24 January 2014).  The estimate also includes 1,200 people forcibly evicted by the police in June 2014 in Wingima, near the Porgera gold mine in Enga province (AI, 21 August 2014). The number was calculated based on the fact that each of the 200 homes destroyed housed one family and that the average household size in rural areas in Papua New Guinea is at least 6 (CARE, October 2011, p. 25).  Natural-hazard-related displacement  The number of people displaced by natural hazard-related disasters is estimated at 15,000. They consist of Manam islanders displaced by a volcanic eruption in 2004 and who have since been living in 3 camps in Bogia and Sumkar districts, Madang province. The population breakdown for the 3 camps is as following:  Mangem care center: 4,000 IDPs  Assuramba care center: 3,000 IDPs  Potsdam care center: 8,000 IDPs  The source for this figure is Paul Akuram, Manam relocation project coordinator. The figure is the result of a survey carried out in 2014 by the local authorities (IDMC interviews, October 2014). In 2012, a Local Level Government (LLG) representative estimated the number of IDPs in the care centers at between 15,000 and 16,000 (ABC, 26 September 2012).  Figures limitations  IDMC’s estimates are conservative as many displacement incidents remain under-reported. Data collection on the number or needs of IDPs in PNG is a major challenge in the absence of any comprehensive monitoring of displacement at the national level. Disaster monitoring and data collection systems are weak and disaster management at the provincial level local level is constrained by poor resources and capacity (WB, 2010, p. 11).  There is also no clear IDP definition at the national level and available data on natural hazard-related disasters does not distinguish between people who are “affected” and “displaced”. Moreover, data collection is hampered by lack of access. Ethnic clashes, the main cause of conflict-related displacement, often take place in remote areas where access is hindered by difficult terrain but also by ongoing insecurity, in particular in the Highlands region.  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it. 446\n"

      "Over 8,000 families have been evacuated from their homes in Asunción after the Paraguay river overflowed.  Paraguay’s National Emergency Secretariat (SEN) in coordination with the local disaster authority, Consejo Municipal de Emergencias y Desastres de Asunción (Comueda), have carried out the evacuations from the low-lying bañados areas of the city, in particular Bañado Norte.  SEN said on Wednesday that, “the number of families affected by the flooding in the capital already exceeded 7,000, after the level of the Paraguay river increased by 113 cm in just 17 days…”  The families are being houses in over 70 temporary shelters. Food kits have been distributed by Comueda, who said yesterday that the number of evacuated families had grown to 8,713 families. According to Comueda, 3,910 of these families have been evacuated from the Bañado Sur area, and 4,803 from Bañado Norte.  As of 30 July 2015, Administración Nacional de Navegación y Puertos (ANNP) report that the Paraguay river stood at 6.13 metres at Asunción, having fallen 2 cm in the last 24 hours. Flood levels is 5.50 metres.  Higher than normal rainfall in the north and east of Paraguay during July caused the significant increase of the Paraguay river levels. According to ECHO, the Paraguay river has also overflowed in the departments of San Pedro and Guaira.  This is the second time in the space of a few weeks that large-scale evacuations have been carried out in the city as a result of flooding or the threat of flooding. In early June 2015, 4,917 families in the low-lying bañados areas of the city were evacuated as a precaution after levels of the Paraguay river rose to 5.45 metres. 447\n",
      "A boy uses a boat to get around a flooded neighbourhood in Asuncion on December 24, 2015 (AFP Photo/Norberto Duarte)  Asuncion (AFP) - Flooding dampened Christmas eve celebrations in parts of Latin America on Thursday, leaving five people dead and driving almost 150,000 from their homes in Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay.  Some 130,000 people have been forced from their homes across Paraguay, officials said, as President Horacio Cartes declared a state of emergency to free up more than $3.5 million in disaster funds.  Three people traveling Paraguay's international Route 2, which links Asuncion and Foz de Iguazu in Brazil were killed when a tree fell on their vehicle before dawn.  Another woman traveling by motorcycle in Asuncion was killed by a falling tree overnight, official sources told AFP.  The National Emergency Secretariat (SEN) reported a dozen other similar incidents in the capital.  The agency's head of operations, David Arellano, said rescue and evacuation operations were underway for dozens of families in the face of floodwaters from the Paraguay River.  Around the capital Asuncion 125,000 homes were without power and 17 power distribution centers knocked out across the country.  Northeastern Argentina also reported widespread disruption and one fatality from the worst flooding in half a century.  A 13-year-old boy was electrocuted by a power cable while trying to assess storm damage to his home in the city of Corrientes, local media reported.  In Entre Rios province at least 10,000 people were evacuated, with Concordia, a city of some 170,000 on the banks of the Uruguay River, the worst affected with nonstop rain throughout the night, Mayor Enrique Crest said.  \"This is the worst flooding in 50 years,\" he said, adding that although \"flooding was predicted due to El Nino, no one thought that it would be so substantial.\"  The city is located 18 kilometers (11 miles) from the Salto Grande dam, which was helping to hold the waters back, but was nearing its full capacity, Crest said.  The governor of Entre Rios said the total number of evacuees across the province could rise to \"between 16,000 to 20,000.\"  Argentina's vice president, Gabriela Michetti, traveled Thursday to the affected region to view the damage and assess disaster relief needs.  The country has declared a state of emergency for the Panama, Uruguay and Paraguay rivers and their tributaries, following exceptionally high rainfall.  In November and December, the Rio de la Plata river basin in Argentina's northeast received between 150 and 300 millimeters more rain than is typical for the period, the farm industry ministry said in a statement.  Uruguay on Wednesday also declared a state of emergency in three northern departments affected by flooding.  The number of displaced people reached almost 5,500 Thursday, as the situation worsened. 448\n",

Roads in the area are impassable and around 20 houses have been damaged, with at least five of them destroyed. Emergency accommodation has been set up for the displaced in a local school, the emergency Institution Virgen del Carmen. The regional government and Peru’s Civil Defence are providing food and aid. Work is also being carried out on the river in order to prevent further flooding.  More heavy rains and storms are expected over the next 2 days. The severe weather is most likely to affect areas further east in central Peru.  Floods and Drought  Perus has endured a period of weather extremes during the last few months, with some areas experiencing floods and others drought.  A state of emergency was declared in the Peru region of Madre de Dios after heavy rainfall on 27 January caused the Tambopata and Madre de Dios rivers to overflow.  Meanwhile, the far north western region of Tumbes, which lies on the border with Ecuador, is experiencing a drought severe enough to be putting livestock and crops at risk.  The district mayor, Rodrigo Astudillo Merino told local media that around 50% of the region’s famring is affected, with 70,000 livestock and over 300 hectares of crops are at risk.  It is a similar situation in the neighbouring region of Piura.  Sources: El Comercio 452\n",
      "Silvia Zambrano.  Cusco.  La lluvia torrencial que cayó en la ceja de selva cusqueña durante más de cinco horas, entre la noche del 31 diciembre y la madrugada de ayer, provocó la crecida del río Quellomayo que al desbordarse originó un huaico que dejó 25 familias damnificadas y 100 afectadas. Además, seis casas se derrumbaron y se destruyó la única vía de salida e ingreso hacia Cusco. No se reportaron heridos ni fallecidos.  El hecho ocurrió a las dos y treinta de la madrugada cuando los habitantes del distrito de Quellouno, provincia cusqueña de La Convención, a unas 7 horas de viaje de la Ciudad Imperial, dormían luego de recibir el Año Nuevo. La mayoría de calles del pueblo se convirtieron en pequeños riachuelos.  “Era como si todo el cerro se viniera sobre nosotros. Apenas pudimos saltar de nuestras camas, coger algunas ropas y salir corriendo todos de nuestras casas. Felizmente el desastre no pasó a mayores”, contó a través del hilo telefónico uno de los pobladores damnificados.  El desastre natural también dejó aislados a alrededor de 16 mil pobladores del distrito de Quellouno. El violento desfogue además destruyó las redes que proveían de agua potable a la población, informó el alcalde distrital Jesús Lobatón Amao.    AFECTADOS  En tanto, cuarenta damnificados y afectados fueron evacuados temporalmente a los ambientes de la institución educativa José Olaya. A la zona llegó muy temprano la alcaldesa provincial de La Convención, Fedia Castro Melgarejo, llevando ayuda consistente en carpas, ropa de abrigo, frazadas, alimentos no perecibles y agua. La población se organizó para preparar sus alimentos en ollas comunes.  Las autoridades municipales dispusieron cuatro unidades de maquinaria pesada para realizar el proceso de limpieza del cauce del río, que fue obstruido en la zona llamada Quellomayo. Pese a que Defensa Civil brinda apoyo a los damnificados, el esfuerzo todavía es insuficiente.  \"Pedimos que nos ayuden, necesitamos más maquinarias porque las que tenemos no son suficientes, hay que limpiar el cauce del río a fin de que no se produzcan más embalsamientos que pongan en riesgo a la población\", refirió Castro.  Agregó que otra labor urgente es la rehabilitación de la carretera que une al distrito con la capital Quillabamba, para ello también se necesita maquinaria y obreros.  \"También debemos evaluar la más de 20 viviendas que han quedado dañadas\", dijo.  EMERGENCIA EN QUELLOUNO  El alcalde distrital de Quellouno, Jesús Lobatón Amao, declaró en emergencia la jurisdicción.  \"Parte del pueblo está totalmente afectado, quiero alertar al Gobierno Central para que vaya previendo las contingencias que se podrían dar; por eso, como primera medida de mi comuna hemos declarado en emergencia a la capital distrital\", indicó.  A su vez, la alcaldesa provincial Fedia Castro demandó al Ejecutivo nacional el envío de apoyo inmediato a la zona. “La situación es de emergencia, no hay desgracias personales que lamentar, pero sí persisten las lluvias y la maquinaria no logra limpiar el cauce del Quellomayo. Podría venir otra avalancha”, precisó.  El distrito de Quellouno, nombre quechua que significa “Agua Amarilla”, es uno de los nueve distritos de la provincia de La Convención, goza de un importante ingreso por canon gasífero, pero no cuenta con maquinaria pesada. 453\n"

      "According to Peru’s Civil Defense Institute (INDECI), around 3,000 people from 690 families have been forced from their homes after several days of heavy rain caused flooding in areas of San Martin region, northern Peru. Peru’s central government has since declared a state of emergency in the region.  The heavy rain caused the Huallaga and Huayabamba rivers to overflow, inundating around 3,000 hectares of farmland, as well as causing damage to homes and property.  The rain has been falling for several days. The Regional Government of San Martin, in co-ordination with INDECI, have been helping shore up flood defences and distribute relief supplies, including tents, sandbags, blankets and food rations since 20 January. However, distribution of supplies has been hampered by the floods, which have damaged or blocked roads in the region.  The San Martin region was affected by floods in late December 2014 when 2 people died. 455\n",
      "The heavy rain and resulting floods and landslides have prompted the government in Peru to declare a state of emergency in Tumbes, Cajamarca, Lima, Tacna and Moquegua regions over the last week.  Further rainfall has been forecast until 05 April 2015. Some river levels remain high, particularly in the north of the country, and alerts have been issued.  At least 22 people have been killed in floods and landslides since the heavy rainfall began around 22 March 2015. There are many people still missing. These figures are likely to change as more thorough assessments are carried out. Floods and numerous landslides have blocked roads, and authorities are yet to reach some of the affected areas.  Tumbes Region  As of 30 March 2015, the government of Peru officially declared state of emergency in the Tumbes region.  Heavy rainfall since 26 March 2015 has caused landslides, mudslides and increased flow of rivers and tributaries in the region in the country’s far north. The Tumbes and Zarumilla rivers have overflowed, damaging houses, roads and infrastructure in the three provinces of the region (Contralmirante Villar, Tumbes and Zarumilla).  At least 500 homes and hundreds of hectares of crops have been affected in several districts of the region, reported the regional president, Ricardo Flores Dioses,as quoted in local media. The technical secretary of the Regional Emergency Operations (COER), Eduardo Arbulú said that in this region there nearly 1,900 families affected by the rains.  Flooding has also caused widespread damage to crops in the region, affecting over 6,000 producers, according to a report by the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MINAGRI), who said that over 7,500 hectares of rice, organic bananas, cocoa and lemons have all suffered damage.  On 29 March 2015, Peru’s meteorological agency, SENAMHI, recorded flow of the Zarumilla river to be 1362.07 m3 per second, which is the highest recorded since last year and more than twice the normal flow.  INDECI, Peru’s civil protection agency, has recommended that residents living in areas along the Zarumilla river to relocate to safe areas on higher ground.  Cajamarca Region  La Republica are reporting that at least 14 people have died in landslides in Cajamarca region since the recent heavy rains began.  Five people died in a landslide in Nuevo Horizonte, Sócota, and three in a landslide in Santa Cruz de Cutervo. Landslides and floods have destroyed roads and have made areas of the region inaccessible. On the road linking Cutervo to Jaén there have been as many as 30 landslides. La Republica say that other victims died as they were unable to reach a hospital and receive medical care in time. Districts including Choros, Sacilia, Cujillo, Toribio Casanova, La Ramada and La Capilla are either completely or partially cut off.  On 28 March 2015, the central government declared a state of emergency lasting 60 days for 21 districts affected by heavy rains, floods and landslides in Cajamarca region.  The affected districts include Jaén, Colasay, San Luis de Lucma, Choros, Socota, Callayuc, Cutervo, La Ramada, Santa Cruz, Toribio Casanova, Santo Domingo de La Capilla and Querocotillo.  Local media say that around 15,000 people near Jaén have been cut off after a river overflowed, blocking an important road. INDECI say that 232 families in Jaén have been made homeless by the floods and landslides.  Almost 4,000 hectares of crops have been damaged in Chota and Cutervo provinces in the region.  Lima Region  In Lima region, landslides occurred in the district of Lurigancho-Chosica on 23 March, killing eight people and injuring 25, while another six people were still missing and over 150 houses were destroyed, as of 24 March 2015.  Media say that as many as 13 landslides have been recorded in Chosica since 23 March 2015. The floods and landslides were caused by torrential rainfall on 23 March 2015 which, according to some reports, lasted or over 6 hours.  Another landslide occurred in Huarochiri province of Lima on the same day, injuring 30 people and destroying 110 houses.  The landslides blocked major roads linking Lima to the central Andes. Chosica also suffered severe flooding after the Rimac river overflowed. Levels of the river have since started to fall, according to a report of 31 March 2015 from SENAMHI.  The road has since re-opened and a state of national emergency was declared in Chosica surrounding areas on 25 March 2015 in order to allow quicker access to relief and repair funds. The President of Peru and local authorities have visited the zone and are assisting the affected population in coordination with INDECI and other state authorities.  Practical Action Flood Resilience Project  Practical Action, the development charity, currently has a team of people working in the Chosica district of Lima.  Colin McQuistan, policy and practice advisor on disaster risk reduction and climate change said: “The fatalities have been from informal communities located high up in the river basin. They have been hit by both mud avalanches and erosion of the land on which they live.  “This is a poor area of Lima. Along the river temporary and unofficial housing is growing and coming ever closer to the river bank. We have been working with the municipal government and local community leaders to put in place reliable effective methods of evacuation, to ensure housing is better able to withstand this type of event and to improve the ability of people to recover their livelihoods after flooding or landslides”.  Practical Action has been working in the affected area for the last few months, initiating a project designed to make those living on the banks of the Rio Rimac more resilient to flooding and better prepared to cope when a disaster strikes.  About the project, Colin McQuistan said:  “Unfortunately, the project is still in its early stages and our work has mainly been with communities lower down the river basin and not those affected by the landslides. So while we have not been able to prevent the loss of life this time, we believe that in future people near to the Rio Rimac will be far better equipped to survive such floods.  “It is ironic that this has happened just days after the World Conference for Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai, Japan where we argued strongly that urban development must take into account climate change and the threat of disasters such as flooding.  “Poverty, vulnerability and disasters are linked”  “Poverty, vulnerability and disasters are linked – it is most often the poorest that are worst affected and suffer most. Their poverty makes them more vulnerable. Their capacity to cope with disasters and recover from the effects are constrained by their lack of resources. But if their risk is managed then dramatic flood events need not turn into tragic disasters.”  The project is one of a number Practical Action has been implementing in communities vulnerable to climate change throughout the world as part of the Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance programme.  Video of the floods in Chosica, Peru:  Tacna Region  Heavy rain resulted in floods and landslides in district of Ilabaya, province of Jorge Basadre in Tacna region on 26 March 2015. Houses, roads, infrastructure and crops have all been damaged. Peru’s central government has since declared a state of emergency for the district.  Moquegua Region  The government has also declared a state of emergency in the province of General Sánchez Cerro ; and the province of Mariscal Nieto, in the Moquegua region.  Forecast and Alerts  Further rainfall is expected until 05 April 2015 at least, although the rain is unlikely to be as intense as previous weeks.  SENAMHI have issued alerts of Level 2 or 3 for the regions of Ancash, Arequipa, Ayacucho, Cajamarca, Huancavelica, Huanuco, Junin, La Libertad, and Pasco.  SENAMHI say that levels of the Tumbes, Chira, Piura and Jequetepeque rivers are all high and, as of 31 March 2015, are still increasing. A red alert remains in place for these rivers.

      "Several rivers in the San Martín department of Peru have overflowed after a period of heavy rain.  Over 2,000 families have been affected by the floods. INDECI, Peru’s National Institute of Civil Defence, report that around 300 families have been left homeless. The floods have completely destroyed 27 houses in the region, and a further 276 houses have been severely damaged, leaving them uninhabitable according to INDECI.  The Huallaga, Huayabamba, Serrano, Saposoa, Tonchima and Mayo rivers have all overflowed at some point since 01 December 2015. In San Martín department, the provinces of Mariscal Caceres, Picota, Huallaga, Rioja, Moyobamba, Bellavista and San Martín have all been affected.  Six bridges and around 15 km of highway have been damaged by the floods. Almost 5,000 hectares of farmland has also suffered damaged and 440 hectares of crops has been completely destroyed. More rain is expected over the next 48 hours in parts of Peru.  San Martín regularly sees flooding around this time of year. Two people died in floods in San Martin in early December last year. Flooding struck again a few weeks later in January 2015 around 3,000 people were forced from their homes. 458\n",

      "COTABATO CITY, Philippines – Relief workers started distributing on Friday individual food packs to more than 10,000 families displaced by flashfloods that hit parts of Maguindanao’s nearby Sultan Kudarat town Wednesday.  In a statement Friday, the Humanitarian Emergency Assistance and Relief Team (HEART) of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) said the dispersal of the relief supplies was led by ARMM Gov. Mujiv Hataman and officials of the Sultan Kudarat local government unit.  Flashfloods, spawned by heavy rains early this week, swept through swaths of low-lying areas in 10 barangays in Sultan Kudarat, displacing thousands of villagers.  The affected areas are close to rivers that overflowed, swelled by heavy downpours.  Workers of HEART evacuated to higher grounds hundreds of families from the flooded areas with the help of the police and the Army’s 6th Infantry Division.  The HEART said continuing medical and other relief services will also be extended to the flood victims. 483\n",

      "SOFIA Rescue teams evacuated over 500 people overnight from the small Bulgarian town of Mizia after torrential rains caused flooding that claimed at least one casualty, an interior ministry official said on Sunday.  Rescue teams with boats and helicopters were still evacuating stranded people on Sunday. One man was found dead in his flooded home, said Nikola Nikolov, head of the ministry's fire safety and civil protection unit.  Over 50 houses have collapsed after the Skut River, which runs through the town, burst its banks. Hundreds of houses remain under water. Another town and several villages in the northwestern area, which is close to the Danube, were also hit by floods.  \"It was terrible, terrible. The water kept coming and coming. My home is under water. Luckily I have an aunt who lives in the higher parts of the town. I think we will be at least 30 people in that house tonight,\" Valia Mircheva, a farmer from Mizia, told BTV television.  The rains have ceased, and weather forecasters say they do not expect heavy rain in the next few days.  Floods this summer have killed more than 15 people in Balkan countries Bulgaria and Romania.  Three people drowned in southwestern Romania and another was missing after heavy floods last week, which hit over 250 villages and triggered the evacuation of over 2,000 people.  Around 11 Bulgarians died after a flood wave ripped through the Black Sea city of Varna in June.

      "At least four people have died in flooding incidents across southern Romania over the last few days.  In a similar situation to other Balkan countries, in particular Serbia and Bulgaria, heavy rainfall that began a few days ago, combined with melting snow, has led to increased river levels and flooding. Flood alerts for several rivers still remain in place.  Reports claim that around 235 people had to be evacuated form their homes. Around 10 counties in the south of the country have been affected by the flooding. Agriculture in the region has also been badly hit, with over 10,000 hectares of crops and pasture damaged by the floodwater.  Minister of Interior, Deputy Prime Minister Gabriel Oprea, confirmed on Monday 21 April 2014, that 4 people have been found dead after drowning in the flooding. He also confirmed that the flood situation seems to be improving and that the number of villages or localities affected by the floods has decreased from 86 to 35.

      "2 Mar 2014  BLAGOVESHCHENSK, 2 March (BelTA) – Belarusian constructors are ready to build houses for the flood-hit Amur Oblast, Deputy Premier of Amur Oblast Vladislav Bakumenko told media.  “Builders (from Belarus) have already arrived in the oblast. The parties are now working with the documents, deciding on the cost and the choice of the construction site,” Vladislav Bakumenko said at the government’s meeting.  Agriculture and Food Minister of Belarus Leonid Zayats who leads the Belarusian delegation that arrived to Amur Oblast on 1 March noted that the issue pertains 65 houses. “These are wooden houses from Belarusian natural wood. They only need to be assembled here (in Amur Oblast). It takes five days to assemble a house of the kind,” Leonid Zayats said.  In his words, Belarus suggests three designs – 42, 60 and 90 square meters.  According to Governor of Amur Oblast Oleg Kozhemyako, a large-scale construction of houses in the flood-hit region will start on 12 March.  A total of 120 apartments have been purchased at the secondary market for the flood victims in Amur Oblast. According to the Ministry of Construction and Architecture of Amur Oblast, there should be constructed 104 municipal and 106 private houses by 30 September 2014. Amur Oblast has already received RUB348 million from the federal budget for the construction and major overhaul of dwelling hit by the natural disaster. 508\n",
      "This figure includes IDPs who fled both Chechen wars (1994-1996 and 1999-2000), as well as those who fled North Ossetia’s Prigorodny region in 1992 after clashes between ethnic Ingush and Ossetians. The estimate includes:  - 378 people who fled North Osssetia, Chechnya and Ingushetia and were granted “forced migrant” status by the government from 2005 to 2014;  - 15,000 IDPs in Chechnya  - 10,000 IDPs in Ingushetia  IDMC considers that the number of IDPs is likely to be higher for three reasons.  First, the figure may not include a few thousand IDPs who have been able to renew their “forced migrant” status since it was first granted.  Second, the government uses a more restrictive definition of an internally displaced person than the one outlined in the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. According to its 1995 Law on Forced Migrants, a “forced migrant” is a person displaced between provinces of the Russian Federation. Those displaced within a province of the Russian Federation are not eligible for “forced migrant” status. As a result, government figures do not take into account people displaced within Chechnya and North Ossetia.  Third, in practice many people who fled from Chechnya to another province did not receive “forced migrant” status even though they were eligible according to the Law on Forced Migrants. As a result, government figures do not take into account people displaced to Dagestan, or most ethnic Chechens, who fled from Chechnya during the second conflict.  Fourth, “forced migrant” status expires after five years according to the Law on Forced Migrants. The holder can extend it on an annual basis thereafter, but this has proven difficult for many IDPs due to inconsistent application of the law. Some IDPs have applied to the court to have their status extended, but not all have been successful.  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it. 509\n",
      "On Thursday February 14, 2013, The Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugee Affairs (MIDIMAR) donated non-food items as relief to families who were left homeless by heavy rain that devastated Kirehe District in the same week.  The donated items included saucepans, bed covers, soaps, hygienic tools and various kitchen utensils in order to assist families who were accommodated by their neighbors after heavy rain completely destroyed their houses and washed away all their home tools.  The heavy rain with storm that beat Kirehe District on Monday February 11, 2013 destroyed more than 170 houses including five classrooms, six church buildings, for local administration offices and 27 hectares of plantations. The most affected sector were Gahara and and Gatore.  According to Eric BUDEDERI, MIDIMAR official in charge of response, the donation was a first aid as the Ministry continues to do advocacy and mobilize resources in order to find iron sheets to support the vulnerable victims whose houses were completely demolished.  District authorities commended the efforts of MIDIMAR to respond in a very quick manner but also pledged to increase the campaign to sensitize the residents to strongly fix the roofs of their houses and knit them with solid materials in order to prevent the consequences of similar wind and storm.  “We are very grateful to MIDIMAR for providing this assistance in such a short period after the incident and we believe that we continue to work together to find more assistance for those who are most affected.” Said Jacquline Murekatete, the Vice Mayor in charge of social affairs in Kirehe District  The Vice Mayor also said that local authorities will increase their efforts in sensitizing the population on disaster prevention by planting windbreak trees and build strong houses with durable and solid materials. 510\n",
      "Graves inondations dans le Nord-ouest du Rwanda  Kigali, Rwanda (PANA) - Les pluies torrentielles tombées cette semaine sur le district de Nyabihu, situé dans le Nord-ouest du Rwanda, ont fait d'importants dégâts dans la communauté des agriculteurs, détruisant au moins quelque 42 maisons, après avoir emporté leurs toitures, rapporte vendredi la radio publique.    Cette catastrophe naturelle est la deuxième du genre qui frappe cette région en moins d'une année après celle qui a détruit au mois d'avril 2012 plusieurs écoles et d'autres infrastructures de développement, notamment, dans les districts de Musanze (nord), Rubavu et Nyabihu (nord-ouest).

      "At least ten people have been confirmed dead and over 30 others injured after they were struck by lightning in Western and Northern provinces this evening.  Eight people including five students were killed in Karongi District, one died in Rutsiro District while another victim was reported in Musanze, according to police.  Police said that all that were injured were immediately rushed to hospital.  Inspector of Police Theobald Kanamugire, the western regional police spokesperson, confirmed the deaths of eight people in his jurisdiction but could not give their identities.  Lightning also killed a 24-year old woman identified as Jeannette Mujawamariya, in Rwaza sector, Musanze District, according to police.  Chief Superintendent of Police Celestin Twahirwa, police spokesperson, said police is still gathering information countrywide to know the exact number of people and property affected by the heavy rain which was characterised by incessant lightning strikes.  Meanwhile over 50 houses were left roofless and hectares of crops, mostly banana plantations, were washed away during the rain in Musanze, according Martin Ntirenganya, the social protection officer at the district.  The Rwanda Meteorology Agency (RMA) this week asked government departments in charge of disaster management to prepare for above normal rains with El Niño torrential rains expected to start soon.  Experts predicted that the Western, Southern and Northern provinces will be most hit.  Precautionary measures taken by the Ministry Disaster Management and Refugee Affairs include urging people to keep off bicycles and motorcycles, avoid wet grounds, refrain from standing near open windows as well as avoid handling electrical equipment during rain.  People should also stay away from tall trees, fences, telecommunication masts, and power lines when it is raining and install lightening conductors on top of their houses. 512\n"

      "Solomon Islands floods: Thousands remain in Honiara evacuation centres  Updated  Authorities in Solomon Islands say 23 people have died and 9,000 are homeless following disastrous flash floods, landslides and strong winds.  The Solomon's National Disaster Council says the victims who lost their homes occupying 24 evacuation centres around Honiara.  The National Emergency Operations Centre says the numbers are continuing to increase across all centres.  The director of the National Disaster Management Office, Loti Yates, has raised concerns over sanitation at the evacuation centres, which are lacking proper water supply.  \"There is a very real risk of an outbreak of disease - including dyentry, malaria, dengue fever and other diseases related to poor sanitation,\" Mr Yates said.  Sorry, this video has expired Video: World Vision says more international assistance required (ABC News)  The Solmon Islands government has allocated $5million in emergency funds for the relief effort.  Australia and New Zealand have sent aircraft, equipment and specialist teams, as well as money, to assist in the clean up.  Cherise Chadwick from Solomon Islands Red Cross has told Asia Pacific thousands are still in evacuation centres in the capital, Honiara.  \"Many of those people are not sure what they're returning back to,\" she said.  \"They left their houses as the flooding was in process, and they haven't gone back yet, so it's very hard to know if they're going back to a damaged house, or a completely destroyed house at this stage.\"  Honiara has been effectively split in two, after the Old China Town bridge completely collapsed on Thursday, and the Mataniko bridge was reduced to one lane.  Major infrastructure including the sewerage system and water supplies have been badly damaged or destroyed.  Ms Chadwick says that's a major worry for those in evacuation centres.  \"We're quite concerned about the possibility of outbreaks of disease due to the problem of water access - as many of these evacuation centres are schools, there's limited water in those schools.  \"The main water network has also been heavily disrupted, so we're trying to get the main water network up and running, but that's obviously taking some time.\"  Solomon Islands National Disaster Council says 40,000 people in Guadalcanal are also estimated to have been affected by the disaster.  Assessment teams are being sent to the province, but Ms Chadwick says it remains difficult to access the disaster hit regions.  \"Guadalcanal province itself has been very difficult to access to really get a sense of what actually is the situation out there.  \"We do know that there's been extensive flooding, but obviously access has hampered the efforts to go in and see what the situation is there, but we are expecting a similar situation.\"  World Vision Solomon Islands national director Andrew Catford said a greater level of international support will be required.  \"One of the things that can hamper relief efforts is the funding doesn't come in as quickly as what you're having to implement, and certainly that's been the case so far,\" he said.  \"Given the scale of this, 12,000 people in Honiara, 40,000 approximately in rural areas, it's going to be not a terribly cheap exercise to get those people back on their feet.\"  The Australian Government has increased its travel warning for Honiara, advising visitors to exercise a high degree of caution and follow the instructions of local authorities.

      "According to African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM), the total number of people displaced by the recent flooding in Somalia has now risen to 21,000.  The flooding struck in Beletweyne, in the Hiiraan region, South-central of Somalia, after the River Shabelle burst its banks in late October 2014.  Further heavy rainfall over the last 2 weeks has forced thousands more to leave their homes for higher ground. The affected families have settled in temporary shelters at a camp close to the AMISOM base camp, North Eastern Beletweyne.  Major Ali Hussein, an AMISON spokesman said  “We are looking at how we can evacuate them or offer medication, but they need much more than that. On the side of the food and so on, they are being provided with clean water by the use of water tankers but they need food and medicines urgently. There is possibility of water borne diseases outbreak, and they don’t have sanitation facilities”  Aid agencies have warned that the floods are likely to worsen the already fragile food security situation, with at least 1 million people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance across Somalia. A statement by the Food Agriculture Organization released last week indicates that the floods have left large areas with crops submerged, further exposing the population to food insecurity. 520\n",

      "More than 100,000 people have been displaced by flooding in six of South Sudan's 10 states, and with the rain still coming down, the numbers are expected to rise, relief officials said Wednesday.    The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said flooding has displaced people in Warrap, Unity, Upper Nile, Northern and Western Bahr el Ghazal, and Jonglei states.    Warrap state is the worst hit with more than 43,000 people impacted by the flooding, nearly half of them in Twic county, National Relief and Rehabilitation Commission Chairman Peter Lam Both said.    In Jonglei state, more than 30,000 people were forced to flee their homes, acting governor Gabriel Gai Riam said.    “We have evacuated the affected persons or communities to high ground, and some of them to schools,\" he said, adding that emergency crews have been called in to dig tunnels to channel water away from people's dwelling places.    Emergency workers have been able to reach only about 800 of the families in Warrap with emergency shelters, food and water purification tablets, and have distributed some 41,000 doses of anti-malaria drugs in anticipation of a spike in the number of cases of the disease, which is transmitted by mosquitos hatched in stagnant water, officials said. 527\n"

      "(November 20, 2013) - At least 15783 people have been displaced in fresh floods in Gogrial East County of Warrap state.  Wol Anyei Anyei the Gogrial East County Commissioner said the floods arose when Jur River burst its banks and many areas including the County headquarters have been affected.  The Commissioner further said the waters have led to an increase in snakes in his county as such cases of snake bites are still being reported.  “Until now the people who died due to snake bite have reached 54, and those who died because of diseases can’t be accounted,” he said.  “The water occupied and displaced people and there is no network in some places. The network is only in the headquarters and Mayenrol market.”  The floods have also delayed distribution of relief items, including mosquito nets and plastic sheets, dispatched by the national government. 528\n",
      "The rainy season has resulted in flooding in 8 states in Sudan, and severe flooding in South Sudan’s Unity state.  In Sudan over the last few days over 3,000 houses have been destroyed and over 6,000 families displaced by flooding. Eight states have been affected in total, although many of the displaced are from the states of River Nile and North Kordofah, in particular the Hamrat Alwiz area in Jabrat al-Shiekh locality where around 700 homes were destroyed.  The latest flooding comes just days after a state of emergency was called in Khartoum state. Sudan Vision are reporting that at least 14 people have been killed in flooding since 25 July 2014, including 11 that were killed in last week in the Omdadda neighbourhood in Omdurman, Khartoum state.  In South Sudan, as many as 42,000 have been displaced by flooding in Unity state. The conditions of the displaced is thought to be extremely poor. Many are without adequate shelter or food supplies and cases of malaria are increasing. Crops have also been destroyed, adding to fears of food shortages. 529\n",
      "October 9, 2014 (BOR) – Thousands of people have been displaced and some 3,260 homes destroyed by heavy flood waters in Jonglei state’s Twic East county.  Seven schools and four primary health care units were also reportedly destroyed following three consecutive days of heavy rain from 3 to 7 October.  According to county commissioner Dau Akoi, the dykes around the villages, some of which were constructed by the Jonglei Food Security Program (JFSP), a project implemented by Catholic Relief Service (CRS) with USAID funding, have been washed down.  Akoi described the current situation in the area as a disaster.  “People are displaced to higher places in Baping and Dong. Houses fell and more will collapse in water. You rarely the see the ground, there is water all over,” he told Sudan Tribune on Thursday.  He said 17 villages in Nyuak, Kongor and Lith payams (districts) are badly affected by flooding.  The raising levels of the Nile water is also threatening the county’s primary dyke after rupturing it in three places.  While community members in Kongor had repaired one of the holes, water was flowing freely in another two areas.  “The flow of water is heavy and dangerous to people who may try to close them. This even makes the situation worse,” the commissioner said.  Despite flooding across large areas of the county, the airstrip, which is being closely monitored by the community, has so far remained dry.  Poor road conditions has cut transport from the county to the state capital of Bor, with travellers to Bor and Juba from Pangagor relying on flights.  Traders are also dependent on flight to transport their goods to Panyagoor.  (ST) 530\n",
      "Floods in South Sudan have increased the woes of those communities displaced by the civil war.  Amongst the turmoil of civil war in one of the world’s youngest countries, flooding has added to the misery of some of the 700,000 internally displaced people (IDP) in South Sudan.  On the night of Friday 7 March 2014, heavy rain and strong wind struck the capital city, Juba, leaving extensive areas of one of the two IDP sites immersed in floodwaters and thick mud.  The storm, which lasted only an hour, flattened 646 shelters in the U.N. Tomping Displacement Camp, leaving 8,000 of the 23,000 residents living in flood conditions. Concerned that further rains would worsen conditions, as another big storm was expected, UN International Rescue Committee (IRC) staff have recommended that 10,000 people relocate to the other IDP site in Juba, “UN House”, but people are reluctant to move, said IRC South Sudan Country Director Wendy Taeuber.  Meanwile, communities that fled to swampy areas in South Sudan’s Jonglei state after civil strife swept the country in mid-December have been displaced for the second time in three months by rising floodwaters.  It was reported last week that chiefs of Bor county met with their communities in Malual, Laguli, Mathiang and the Toc area, to decide where to locate to. One of the chiefs, Gabriel Pandek, said that flooding was exacerbating existing problems arising from crowded conditions and the lack of basic sanitation.  He estimated that there are some 67,000 families living in the Toc area, stretching along the Nile River from Pariak to near Gemeza in Central Equatoria state.  “Already there was population pressure in the places we lived. Too many people in small areas, sanitation was our initial problem … Now there is [a] flood,” he said.  Sources: ReliefWeb; VOA News; All Africa; Sudan Tribune 531\n",
      "October 15, 2014 (JUBA) – Red Cross officials in Bor, the capital of South Sudan’s Jonglei state, said at least 900 households have been displaced from their homes following heavy rains last Tuesday night.  A resident walks through flood waters in Bor, the capital of South Sudan’s Jonglei state (ST)  Speaking to Sudan Tribune by phone, David Gai, the director of Red Cross in Bor, said the displaced families are in urgent need of assistance.  “Hai Machuor, Leek-yaak and Block Two are [the] main affected areas,” Gai said, referring to Bor suburbs where large numbers of people were displaced by heavy rains.  “We (Red Cross) have informed our head office in Juba and a convoy of humanitarian items will be sent as soon as possible,” he added.  Bor experiences flooding annually due to heavy rains and overflow from the Nile River.  However, major flooding was largely prevented this year due to the construction of a dyke on the banks of the Nile River by forces from the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) forces in May.  At least half of Bor’s population of 300,000 population, which were forced to flee their homes when violence peaked in January, have returned, according to local officials.  (ST) 532\n",

The mayor of Bor town, Nhial Majak Nhial, in a press address, appealed to communities to fully cooperate with the state authorities in their attempts to open water ways in Bor.  “To drain the town, we have to open the drainage areas in places inhabited by people. If you are living in actually water drainage, we will be able to ask you to cooperate so that we drain 1000 houses, you sacrifice part of your of plot”, Nhial told reporters.  \"People have to come out and open the drain into the main drainage lines. We the people also want to watch in the areas were we have cut the dyke, because we will cut the dyke to let water go into the river, but when the backflow happens, members must intervene first and inform the government so that we intervene in key areas we need”, he added.  The state information minister, Jody Jonglei said government was coming up a budget for a drainage system in town, urging the population to be flexible in dealing with floods.  \"When we made a dyke, we didn’t actually open the way for excess water to go to the river. This is our problem now. The government will focus on them and then we will come with a solution, the people will be flexible actually to give us chance”, he said.  (ST) 534\n"

      "The Val d’Aran’s Syndic – who is the main authority of the County’s General Council –, Carlos Barrera, described the situation on Tuesday evening as “extremely severe and complicated”. The Aran Syndic emphasised that the measures adopted since Friday have ensured that no casualties have happened, despite the severe floods, “which is the most important thing”. “Everybody had many hours to react and this has been a key factor in not having to regret casualties now”, he said. However, he regretted the “colossal” material losses caused by the water. Barrera told the CNA that the Town Hall of Vielha is monitoring the evolution of the Nere River, which crosses the old town, in case they have to evacuate. The town is also crossed by the Garonne River, which rises in the Val d’Aran and discharges into the Atlantic Ocean near Bordeaux.  Work continues to protect areas and properties from the water  Barrera also explained that machines have been working and will continue to work during the night at critical points, such as bridges, to prevent them being blocked and to allow water to continue flowing under them. In addition, extra walls are being built to save areas from the water. This is the case in the industrial area of Mijaran, in Vielha. The water has reached the N-230 road, going from the town to the French border, and a wall is being built diagonally to bring the water towards the river again. The road is closed between kilometres 164 and 187, and therefore the main road communication between the Val d’Aran and France is cut.  Houses and bridges destroyed by the wild mountain rivers  Many people have been evacuated from their homes, since they were at risk. By the end of Tuesday, more than 500 will have to sleep out of their beds. Evacuations have taken place in Les, Bòssost, Arties, Naut Aran and Vielha, among other villages. For instance, the people of Naut Aran will spend the night at a sports pavilion. In addition, the inhabitants of seven houses that have been totally flooded will spent the night in a hotel. A house in Arties has collapsed, as well as another one in Casarilh. In addition, a restaurant in Salardú has the wild waters of the river running right through it. In fact, since it is an area located at a high altitude with high mountain peaks, there are a lot of white waters and rivers tend to transport water in a dangerous way. Now, since they are carrying much more water than normal, the rivers are simply a wild torrent of brown rough waters, mud and branches. The water is so violent that three bridges have been destroyed in Casarilh, Escunyau and Arties.  In fact, the rivers are currently transporting between 10 and 20 times the average volume they have during the year. The Noguera Pallaresa is transporting 160 cubic metres per second and the Noguera Ribagorçana 190. In lower lands they are preparing themselves for the water that will arrive. For instance, the Riba-roja reservoir in Southern Catalonia, on the Ebro River, is releasing 1,400 cubic metres of water per second, as the water from the Western Catalan Pyrenees discharges into the Ebro. The Segre River, passing through the city of Lleida, is already registering high levels of water with 208 cubic metres per second but is expected to reach 500 cubic metres on Wednesday.  Avoiding unnecessary trips  The Catalan Government has insisted that people must not return to their homes until they are told. In addition, only strictly necessary trips are advisable in the area, in order not to put people at risk and to allow emergency services to concentrate on evacuations and building defences against the water. Fire-fighters, police officers and civil protection workers from other areas of Catalonia have been transferred to the affected counties.  Power breakdown but partially restored  In the morning, a large part of Vielha – the Val d’Aran’s capital – was without power, as well as other neighbouring towns. During the day, Endesa – the main electricity company in the area – transported power generators by helicopter and part of the service has been restored. On Tuesday at noon, 4,400 people were without electricity. However, by the end of the day, the number had been reduced to 2,100. Work to restore the service will continue in daylight. 537\n",

      "Una quema agrícola descontrolada en Calles y unas prácticas de tiro en la base militar de Marines son las causas a las que apunta la Generalitat como origen de sendos incendios declarados este miércoles por la mañana en Valencia. Dos imprudencias que obligaron al Consell a pedir apoyo a unidades de otras comunidades autónomas para tratar de sofocar unos fuegos que avanzaban a la vez. La Generalitat ha adelantado este año la campaña de prevención y extinción de incendios porque en los cuatro primeros meses de 2014 se han producido más de la mitad de los siniestros que en todo 2013 (202 fuegos frente a los 349 de todo el año pasado).  Cerca de las 12 del mediodía, el 112 recibía el aviso de la existencia de un incendio en la base militar de Marines, junto al parque natural de la Sierra Calderona. El fuego amenazó durante el día con extenderse a parque natural pero no llegó a salir de terrenos militares según confirmó el consejero de Gobernación, Serafín Castellano. El consejero apuntó a la realización de unas prácticas de tiro en la base como una de las primeras causas investigadas.  Hasta ocho brigadas de emergencias y 13 medios aéreos fueron necesarios para controlar el fuego en Marines. La Unidad Militar de Emergencias (UME), presente en la base militar, se sumó al dispositivo de extinción con 110 militares y 35 vehículos. Durante el día de hoy dos medios aéreos continuarán trabajando en la zona para tratar de extinguirlo.  Antes de conocerse las declaraciones del consejero de Gobernación sobre la causa del fuego de Marines, y ante informaciones que apuntaban a la actividad de la UME como origen del siniestro, fuentes del Ministerio de Defensa negaron que unos ejercicios de esta unidad en la zona pudieran provocar el fuego. Según fuentes de la UME, sus efectivos no se encontraban en la zona donde se inició el fuego sino en otro punto de la base militar realizando ejercicios de lucha contra el fuego. Al conocer el incendio, detuvieron las maniobras para participar en las tareas de extinción.  Ambos incendios están estabilizados y sin llama, pero aún no se han dado por controlados  Menos de una hora después, el 112 recibía un nuevo aviso de incendio en una zona de cañar junto al río Tuéjar en la partida de Torrecilla en la localidad de Calles. El fuego, causado por una quema agrícola descontrolada según fuentes de Emergencias, avanzó río arriba por el cauce y al llegar a Chelva obligó a desalojar de forma preventiva a unas 200 personas.  El Ayuntamiento de Chelva solicitó por megafonía a los vecinos de dos barrios de la zona baja del pueblo, el Arrabal y el Azoque, que subieran a las partes altas para evitar que respiraran el humo del incendio. A las 21.15 de la noche, Emergencias informó a los vecinos que podían volver a sus casas, por lo que finalmente no fue necesario que durmieran en el albergue instalado por el Equipo de Respuesta Inmediata en Emergencias de Cruz Roja con capacidad para un centenar de personas.  El fuego, que quedó estabilizado y sin llamas cerca de las nueve de la noche, no afectó a ninguna vivienda del núcleo urbano aunque llegó a estar a menos de un kilómetro del mismo, según fuentes municipales. Este segundo incendio movilizó hasta a nueve medios aéreos, 11 brigadas y siete dotaciones de los bomberos del Consorcio Provincial. Además, otra unidad de la UME se sumó a las tareas de extinción.  La simultaneidad con el fuego de Marines hizo que la Consejería de Gobernación solicitara ayuda a cuatro medios aéreos: uno de Aragón, dos de Cataluña y uno de Murcia.  El consejero de Gobernación, Serafín Castellano, se desplazó hasta las zonas del incendio para conocer de primera mano el estado de los mismos e informar de su evolución.  Las condiciones ambientales de este año han obligado a adelantar dos semanas la campaña de prevención y extinción de incendios forestales. Las altas temperaturas, los constantes episodios de viento y la escasez de precipitaciones que ha producido un déficit hídrico de un 65% este año, auguran un verano ardiente.  Desde el día 15 de mayo, día de comienzo de la campaña, y hasta que termine la misma las quemas agrícolas están prohibidas. Con 23 grados de temperatura, una humedad relativa menor al 40% y vientos flojos del este, el día de ayer fue calificado de riesgo I. Fuentes de la Consejería de Gobernación, competente en materia de prevención y extinción de incendios, explicaron que no estaba prohibido realizar fuegos en las zonas habilitadas para ello y que la normativa las permite salvo en los días calificados con nivel de riesgo III. 543\n",

Over 28,000 houses have been destroyed, with 2,950 latrines ruined.  Alnour Esmaiel, 45, from Gadain area in Khartoum State says he has lost everything. “My house is completely destroyed. I need shelter. The Sudanese Red Crescent has provided me with one tarpaulin, but this is insufficient for my family of two wives and eight children aged between 18 and 2 years,” he says.  The Sudanese Red Crescent has mobilized over 1,300 volunteers from all its branches to evacuate flood victims, offer first aid services and carry out assessments in the affected areas. So far the society has distributed food, household items and shelter materials from its own stocks, as well as distributed additional items in collaboration with its partners.  Aida Sayied, Sudanese Red Crescent’s health director, says the society’s staff and volunteers are working to support those affected by the floods. “We have opened a clinic in Gadain area of Khartoum State and we have been providing medicine. Unfortunately stocks ran out after one day,” he says. “We urgently need medicine to cater for patients coming in for treatment.”  The Sudanese Red Crescent is monitoring the situation closely in coordination with the government and other partners providing humanitarian assistance to the flood-affected people.  According to reports from the emergency teams, those affected are in urgent need for shelter, food, household items, health services, and water and sanitation facilities to prevent the outbreak of diseases. 551\n",

South Darfur — A downpour has destroyed more than 100 houses in a camp for the displaced near Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, on Sunday.  El Salam camp Sheikh Mahjoub Adam Tabeldiya said that the rains were accompanied by severe winds that lasted for more than four hours. The storm has destroyed houses and left the affected families out in the open without shelter. Tabeldiya appealed, through Radio Dabanga, to the humanitarian organisations, to provide humanitarian assistance and other shelter materials to the families.  In Kalma camp, torrential rains, also accompanied by strong winds, destroyed four classrooms of a mixed basic school. They usually accommodated about 400 students in Square 2.  Sheikh Ali Abdelrahman El Taher, the head of the camp, added that the heavy rainfall has destroyed four houses in Square 5 and four cottages that belong to the World Food Programme.  El Taher described the situation in the camp as \"dire\", because the rains damage houses and schools, and the accumulated water blocks the streets. He demanded the aid organisations in the camp to offer help to the vulnerable people in Kalma, and provide them with plastic sheets, rugs and bed nets.  On Thursday, Radio Dabanga reported that many of the more than 163,000 displaced people in Kalma camp suffer from a shortage of food and poor sanitary provisions.  On 16 July, heavy rains destroyed 761 homes in the camp. The flash floods filled the pits and pools at the camp to the brim. Two days later, two children drowned in one of the pits. 552\n"

      "Trash-choked waterways and development in low-lying areas is combining with more extreme rainfall to drive flooding  PARAMARIBO, Suriname (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – Trash-clogged drainage canals, growing development in low-lying areas and increasingly extreme weather are adding up to worsening flooding in Suriname.  Last month, Suriname was lashed by heavy rains – nearly double the usual rainfall for the period - that led to evacuations and crop and livestock losses as floodwater rapidly overflowed the country’s waterways.  Officials blamed the crisis in part on failure to prepare for the growing risks.  “We’re noticing that the weather patterns are changing and we ratify all those climate change resolutions, but do we really follow through? As long as we don’t, we’ll be mopping up while the water is running,” said Patrick Kensenhuis, a member of parliament for hard-hit Para district.  In Paramaribo, the capital, several residential areas were flooded. In Saramacca district in the west, poultry and vegetable farmers faced heavy losses when the Saramacca River and other waterways proved unable to handle the overflow.  One distraught farmer told the media that he had only been able to save a few of his chickens when the rainwater reached a height of 30 cm (12 inches) inside his coops. “It happened so fast,” he said. Other farmers reported losing all their crops to the floods.  The last time such bad weather hit the country was in June 2006, when more than 450 mm of rain caused rivers in the hinterlands to burst their banks, flooding around 100 villages, killing three people and forcing hundreds to be relocated. This year there were no deaths.  In Para district, which is usually dry, some cassava farmers have lost their entire year’s harvest. Kensenhuis, an area member of parliament, said the weather was a blow to an ongoing effort to establish a cassava meal industry in the district. Cassava is widely considered a climate-resilient crop.  “There are about 70 farmers here who took part in this programme and sowed an average of 3 hectares (about 7 acres),” Kensenhuis said. “They invested thousands of their own money in hopes of making profits.”  He said that 20 of the farmers had lost all their crop, and estimated that the rains may have cost some of them in excess of 50,000 Surinamese dollars (about US $15,000). Some cattle farmers, meanwhile, have suffered losses close to 500,000 dollars ($153,000).  Some 300 people from five communities in Marowijne district, in the east of the country, were relocated when the Cottica River overflowed, reaching up to one metre in depth in their villages.  “All we can do is express solidarity and look for ways to prevent this from happening again in the future,” said Marinus Bee, a member of parliament who led a parliamentary delegation to the area along with President Desi Bouterse.  GARBAGE PROBLEM  But Para District Commissioner Jerry Miranda wrote to the president suggesting that the state get tougher on people who dump garbage.  “We need to get Suriname cleaner. The problem is indeed that we get excessive rains, but the true culprit is the garbage that is dumped on the roadsides and in our canals,” Miranda said in an interview.  “Ironically it’s those same environmental barbarians who dump the garbage who complain later when they’re flooded,” he said. He called for steep fines for anyone caught dumping garbage.  Kensenhuis agreed that dumping is a problem. “Many important canals are indeed clogged. I know the Ministry of Public Works is paying contractors to maintain the canals, but if that work had been done and monitored properly, why are we having this problem with flooding now?” he asked.  He said residents of the affected areas needed better education about steps they could take to mitigate their risks from extreme weather.  According to Sieuwnath Naipal, a hydrologist at the University of Suriname, cleaning and maintaining canals will not by itself solve the problem of flooding.  “This is not one problem, but a combination of many,” which vary by area, Naipal stated in an e-mail.  He noted that the traditional practice of building on higher ground and leaving lower-lying areas for agriculture has changed as the country’s population (currently just over half a million) has grown. Infrastructure and residential developments have moved to coastal areas, and newer canals have smaller gradients, slowing the flow of water.  “Our coastal areas are very fertile, so weeds in the canals grow fast and irrigation is hampered. On top of that there is little to no control on the canals, which are a dumping ground for plastic bottles and other refuse,” Naipal said.  He agreed that the problem is worse because rains have intensified as a result of climate change, including rising seas along Suriname’s coastline.  “Because of the rise of the sea level our rivers are not able to fully handle the overflow that comes from the canals,” he said. Another problem is that “we still continue to parcel out (land) in the coastal areas that used to be under water.”  “Under these circumstances it will be impossible to hold off this problem that returns every year,” Naipal said.

      "Typhoon Trami batters China  TYPHOON Trami has slammed into China, bringing more rain and threatening to worsen severe flooding that has so far left 575 dead and 340 missing.  Packing maximum winds of 126 kilometres per hour, the 12th tropical storm to hit China this year made landfall in the coastal areas of Fujian province's Fuqing City early on Thursday.  It triggered heavy rains that are feared will exacerbate the worst floods in years in China, which have already affected nearly 80 million people, according to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.  \"We will prepare for the worst-case scenario,\" said Shu Qingpeng, a spokesman for the flood control office.  The deluges have caused economic losses of up to 162 billion yuan ($A29 billion), the agency says.  Across the north-eastern border in Russia, up to 40,000 people are at risk as waters in the Amur River rise to new levels near the city of Khabarovsk, according to Acting Governor Vyacheslav Shrot.  \"There've never been any water rises of this kind throughout the 120 years of hydrometeorology observations in the Amur area,\" he said.  About 25,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in Khabarovsk.  Trami left 17 people dead and affected more than 1.2 million in the Philippines, where flood waters up to 2 metres high shut down the capital Manila for three days.  The floods caused damages to infrastructure and agriculture worth an estimated $US1.83 million, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said.  Before crossing to the Chinese mainland, Trami brought torrential rain to northern Taiwan, causing landslides, mudflows and accidents that injured 10 people.  At least 6171 people were forced to evacuate homes, including more than 2600 staying in emergency shelters, according to Taiwan's Central Emergency Operation Center.  Taiwanese weather authorities lifted sea and land warnings on Thursday as Trami blew away from the island. 563\n",

      "THAILAND-FLOODS/:Floods inundate a quarter of Thailand's provinces, warnings issued  By Amy Sawitta Lefevre  BANGKOK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - More than 600,000 Thais have been affected by flooding since July and more than a quarter of Thailand's provinces have been inundated, prompting officials to issue landslide warnings and begin evacuation measures on Monday.  Devastating floods in 2011 killed more than 800 people and caused massive disruption to industry, cutting economic growth that year to just 0.1 percent.  Four people have been killed in this year's flooding. More rainfall is expected later this week.  \"Due to a heavier-than-usual monsoon season, 21 provinces are now experiencing flooding. We have issued a warning about landslides and have told boats in the Gulf of Thailand to be vigilant,\" Chatchai Promlert, chief of Thailand's Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, told Reuters.  Parts of Ayutthaya province north of the capital, Bangkok, have been deluged by up to a metre of water, he said. Ayutthaya town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site where several ancient temples were badly damaged in the 2011 floods.  Many huge industrial estates in Ayutthaya and other provinces on a plain north of Bangkok were inundated in 2011.  At least 10 provinces in Thailand's central plains, the main rice-growing region, have been affected by the floods but the extent of any damage is not yet known.  The flooding has hit in harvest season and output is likely to be affected, but there has been no official comment yet.  Plodprasop Suraswadi, a deputy prime minister, said he was confident there would not be a repeat of the 2011 floods, which at one stage threatened to engulf Bangkok.  \"Water levels in our dams are low enough to handle any extra rainfall,\" Plodprasop said.  Municipal authorities have ordered sandbags stacked around shops and homes and extra water pumps have been installed in many areas.  In Prachin Buri province, 135 km (85 miles) east of Bangkok, more than 700 inmates from a prison were evacuated on Sunday and transferred to other facilities nearby after their cells were flooded.  The national disaster department said it was offering assistance to residents in flood-affected areas, including the provision of life-jackets and boats. Those living in low-lying areas have been advised to move to higher ground.

      "Heavy rain over the last 2 days has caused flooding in the west African countries of Togo, Benin and Ghana. Parts of Côte d’Ivoire have also been affected, in particular Abidjan, which saw 76 mm of rain fall in the last 24 hours.  Ghana  At least 90 people have been killed in a fuel station explosion in Accra, said to have been caused after flood waters swept stored gasoline into a nearby fire. Hundreds of people in Accra have been forced from their homes by the flooding, which has also affected power supplies.  Ghana’s Communications Ministry said in a statement: “Many suburbs of Accra and surrounding parts have been heavily affected, leading to heavy restriction of movement of people. The general public is kindly advised to avoid fast-moving rainwater and areas they know have big drains. Stay on higher ground, where necessary, to prevent loss of life.”  Axim, South Ghana, which lies about 300 km east of Accra saw 88 mm of rain fall in 24 hours to 03 June 2015.  Togo  In Togo, heavy rain from 02 June 2015 has caused flooding in southern parts of the country. Worst affected is the city of Lome, where one person has been killed and several injured after homes were damaged, ECHO report. Local media say that around 5,000 people have been displaced by the floods. Tabligbo in southern Togo saw 73 mm of rain fall in 24 hours.  Benin  In Benin, 84 mm of rain fell in Cotonou in 24 hours to 03 June 2015. Local media say that flooding has damaged several homes and blocked streets in the largest city and economic centre of Benin.  Just last week the World Bank approved a new US$40 million International Development Association (IDA) credit for Benin to improve its infrastructure and minimize the negative impacts of the 2010 floods as well as increase the level of preparedness for any future flooding.  In 2010 the heavy rains in Benin created unexpected rising water levels that overwhelmed the country’s traditional preventive response and resilience mechanisms. As a results 278 schools were flooded and more than 50,000 houses were destroyed leaving 150,000 people without shelter. The 2010 floods ruined 128,000 hectares of crops and farmland and an estimated 12,000 metric tons of food stocks were lost because of destroyed storage facilities.  A Drainage Master Plan and a Solid Waste Management (SWM) Strategy was prepared under the original project in 2014. It revealed significant clogging in numerous points in the drainage system, which, if not treated, could bring about further flooding.  “An additional 94,000 people will no longer be subjected to periodic flooding with today’s new financing that will build on the original project and help improve and expand access to reliable drainage systems in poor areas of Benin,” says Ousmane Diagana, the World Bank’s Country Director for Benin. 597\n",

      "Ha’apai, Tonga, December 17, 2014 – The Ha’apai island group has been a hive of activity since construction on houses for vulnerable families started. Thirty out of the 200 houses have been completed and families started moving into their new two-room, cyclone-resistant homes in October 2014.  Under the Cyclone Ian Reconstruction and Climate Resilience Project, a joint World Bank and Tonga government initiative, up to 350 one-room houses are also set to be constructed with building contracts awarded to two local companies in December 2014. Damaged houses will be repaired and existing houses will be reinforced to withstand future cyclones.  Swift action to assist Tonga  The Category 5 cyclone was the most powerful storm ever recorded in Tonga and had devastating impacts on the Ha’apai island group. An estimated 5,500 people, approximately 70% of the Ha’apai population, were affected. Most of the 1,100 houses and many of the public facilities were damaged or destroyed. Fourteen people were injured and one person died.  Within two weeks of the cyclone, the government received $1.27 million from the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance pilot program, which the country joined in 2013. The pilot program provides participating Pacific Island countries with risk insurance from natural disasters such as cyclones, tsunamis, and earthquakes.  This payment was the first received by any country under the pilot and allowed swift action for on-the-ground support for the Ha’apai people.  “A week after the cyclone, the World Bank team along with the government visited Ha’apai,” said Havea Tu’iha’angana, Governor of Ha’apai. “They started by carrying out surveys and collecting data on damaged houses. I am very thankful for this project because it’s very quick.”  Another $12 million in grants and low interest loans were provided through the World Bank’s Crisis Response Window (CRW). The funds were received within four months of Cyclone Ian, making it the fastest ever payout through the CRW. This was complemented by $2 million in funds from the government. The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery provided a grant of $ 1.8 million to help Tonga prepare for future disasters. 600\n",

      "Heavy rainfall has hit Edirne, a northwestern province on the border with Greece, causing the Tunca and Meriç riverbeds to overflow and forcing hundreds of people to be evacuated from their villages to safer zones on Sunday.    Edirne Governor Dursun Ali Şahin announced the evacuation of 1,500 people in the Karaağaç neighborhood and all residents living in Değirmen Village. The evacuated residents were placed in a public gymnasium hall, as experts expect the river discharge to rise to 2,500 cubic meters per second.    The governorate has requested emergency help from the health ministry, Prime Ministry Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD), and the military.  The overflow of Tunca and Meriç rivers as a result of heavy precipitation caused closures on the main road in Karaağaç neighborhood, where 5000 people reside.AFAD and other presidencies have released their emergency rescue provisions, including enough food for five days and a thousand beds for the evacuated residents.Weather forecast experts have predicted that the strong winds and severe rainfall will continue in western Turkey until the middle of the week, which is likely to continue causing disruptions to residents in the region. 602\n"

      "The figure is based on a 2006 study commissioned by the government and carried out by Hacettepe University. The study concluded that between 954,000 and 1.2 million people were internally displaced from 1986 to 2005 (Haceteppe University, 2006).  The study included a qualitative and quantitative survey. The qualitative survey was conducted in five provinces, while the quantitative survey was based on a national random sample of around 6000 households. The household and individual interviews were conducted with those who returned to their village and those who remained in displacement. The quantitative survey questionnaire was prepared using the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and interviewees were selected through a random number table, also known as the ‘Kish’ method.  IDPs fled their homes due to armed conflict between Turkey and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). More than 30 percent of the persons displaced by violence fled their homes between 1986 and 1990, 60 percent between 1991 and 1995, and the remainder between 1996 and 2005 (Haceteppe University, 2006). The vast majority of displacement movements occurred in the south-east of the country from rural areas to urban centres, where security forces battled Kurdish militias. Some villages in the region were destroyed, and most inhabitants were displaced by the authorities. The village guard system, which was meant to combat the links between Kurdish militia and local villages, also played a part in forced displacement.

      "The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) announced on Thursday 06 November 2014 that at least 16,000 people have been displaced by recent floods in Uganda. Around half of the displaced are thought to be children, according to UNICEF Uganda.  The floods occurred in the western Ugandan district of Ntoroko after the River Semliki burst its banks due to heavy rains. The areas worst affected are Bweramule sub county, Butungama sub county, Rwebisengo sub country and Rwebisengo town.  The river first overflowed around 01 November 2014. Initially around 500 people were displaced, but the affected area has since widened. Roads are submerged and many homes in the area have been damaged. Crops and livestock has also been badly affected.  The Ugandan newspaper The Monitor says that the area is frequently under water at this time of year.:  Floods are a chronic problem in Ntotoko which plague the district every rainy season, displacing hundreds of people and leaving a trail destruction.

      "Lucky David Wilson (in red) filming his music video with Achan Katherine in Unyama trading centre, a former IDP camp in northern Uganda. © UNHCR/S.Perham  GULU, Uganda, January 6 (UNHCR) - Lucky David Wilson was born in a war zone in troubled times, but somehow manages to live up to his name.  As a boy, he fled attacks on his village of Guru Guru when northern Uganda became the frontline in the battle between the Ugandan army and the rebel Lord's Resistance Army. Now 19, he has become a popular singer who uses music to advocate for peace and reconstruction in his homeland.  Wilson is a symbol of the new north, where relative peace has returned since the signing of a cease-fire agreement in 2006.  UNHCR opened an office the same year in the northern town of Gulu to manage 251 camps and provide protection to an estimated 1.84 million internally displaced people (IDPs) in 11 districts. Since then, more than 1.8 million have returned home on their own. To ensure sustainable returns, the UN refugee agency worked with the local authorities to provide basic services in home villages. This involved building community access roads, police posts, schools, health centres and clean water sources and putting in place a public administration infrastructure.  UNHCR also engaged agencies such as the Food and Agriculture Organization, USAID, Care, World Vision and the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund II for longer-term development in areas of return.  \"This is a happy day for all,\" said UNHCR Representative in Uganda, Kai Nielsen, as he closed the Gulu office last week. \"Together with the government and aid agencies, we've managed to find solutions to one of the world's biggest IDP crises and help hundreds of thousands of Ugandans to go home.\"  While most of the IDPs made their own way home, some needed extra support. UNHCR and partners helped 11,600 of the most vulnerable IDPs and returnees by ensuring legal access to land and engaging the community to build huts and latrines. They were also given a start-up kit with blankets, jerry cans, sleeping mats, and kitchen sets, as well as an income safety net with livestock, seeds and tools.  Achan Katherine is one of the beneficiaries. Physically disabled and facing mobility problems, she has chosen to stay at the Unyama trading centre, a former IDP camp. UNHCR worked with the National Union for Disabled Persons in Uganda (NUDIPU) to assess the needs of people like her, and recently distributed wheelchairs to disabled people in Gulu district together with the Association for Volunteers in International Service (AVSI).  Wheelchairs, tricycles, white canes and crutches were designed and built locally by the Gulu Youth Development Association to create jobs, develop skills among the youth and to make the devices available to the greater community.  Katherine, who had been moving on her hands for years, was delighted with her new wheelchair. \"Now I can move around my compound on my own and visit friends,\" she said in her native Acholi-Luo tongue. \"Agencies need to continue this kind of help.\"  She was doubly excited when Lucky David turned up for the distribution and asked her to appear in the music video for his new hit song Roco Gang (Rebuilding Home). Her relatives and neighbours danced around her as he sang his song encouraging youth to support the vulnerable and elderly within their own communities.  \"In our culture, when you do things like helping those who are disabled or having problems, the whole community is appreciative,\" said Lucky David, who is now based in Gulu town. \"I'm so happy to be given the chance to spread these messages.\"  Today, some 30,000 Ugandans remain displaced in northern Uganda, living in four remaining camps, as well as former camps-turned-trading centres and transit sites. More than 6,000 have settled locally. Their need for assistance and protection has diminished as the communities work with aid agencies and the local government to develop and stabilize the region.  The Lord's Resistance Army, however, continues to terrorize civilians in neighbouring countries such as the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan.

      "As thousands of people began cleaning up after record-breaking high tides flooded homes and other buildings along Britain's east coast, ministers warned the crisis was not over yet.  While flood defences and flood warnings leading to mass evacuations in some towns on Thursday night were credited with saving lives, authorities warned that more high tides were expected later on Friday and Saturday.  Although only two people are known to have died in the storms so far – in separate incidents on Thursday – Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, warned that the crisis was not over.  \"There will still be exceptionally high tides today and tomorrow, and I would urge everybody to pay very close attention to advice from the Environment Agency and also to follow instructions from the police, local government and emergency services.\"  Despite overnight flooding not being as severe as expected, it still brought disruption to large areas of England on Friday. 609\n",
      "St Jude, dubbed the Great Storm of 2013, caused devastation as it swept across Britain Sunday night, with two people crushed to death by falling trees, another killed in a gas explosion and a boy missing after being swept out to sea.  Hundreds of thousands of homes have been left without power and rush-hour commuters suffered transport chaos as hurricane-force conditions battered Britain.  David Cameron called the injuries and deaths \"hugely regrettable\" but praised the preparation and response of emergency services.  People watch the waves batter into the sea wall of a marina in Brighton, south England  On a visit to the Mini plant, the Prime Minister told reporters: \"The emergency services, as ever, do a brilliant job. These are difficult things to handle because you don't know for certain how strong the storm will be.  \"That really is the advice to people: things will get back to normal but make sure you consult the relevant websites before you travel.\"  A man in his 50s was killed when a tree fell on the car he was driving in Watford, at around 6.50am, Hertfordshire Police said. Officers closed the road to deal with the incident but the man, from Harrow in north west London, was pronounced dead at the scene.  Meanwhile, a 17-year-old girl was killed in Hever, Kent, when a tree blew on to the caravan where she was sleeping at 7.18am. The teenager, named by sources as Bethany \"Gia\" Freeman, was crushed as the 30ft tree fell down in Lydens Lane, Hever, near Edenbridge, Kent, at 7.18am.  Bethany and her family were living in the caravans while renovation work was taking place at their home, according to two neighbours.  One of them, who declined to be named, said: \"(The family) were planning to join up their two buildings, and they were living in the caravans in order to do it.  \"I don't know who else was there. At the end of the day the tree has come down. I won't criticise anyone working there but not one of the emergency services had a chainsaw.  \"It came down to the locals having chainsaws in order to cut a gap and also the local farmer having lifting gear.\"  The storm's third and fourth victims were found at an address in Hounslow, west London, which was devastated after a falling tree led to a suspected gas explosion this morning.  Five people and three dogs escaped from the properties before firefighters arrived and a man and two women were taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service. Two bodies were found by urban search and rescue crews, who searched the properties for any survivors.  Station Manager Matt Burrows, who was at the scene shortly after the incident, said: “Three houses were completely destroyed in the blast, debris was scattered over an area of about 50 metres, and the roof of one of the houses was in a tree across the road. Highly trained search and rescue crews searched through the rubble with sniffer dogs, and sadly two people were found dead.  “We’re still investigating whether the fallen tree caused the gas explosion or whether the gas explosion caused the tree to fall. It’s likely firefighters will be on scene for much of the rest of the day.”  A 14-year-old boy feared dead after being swept into the sea in rough weather has been named by sources as Dylan Alkins. The teenager disappeared while playing in the surf at West Beach in Newhaven, East Sussex, at about 4.15pm on Sunday.  Rescue teams, including a Coastguard helicopter and an RNLI lifeboat, scoured the area in what were described as \"atrocious conditions\" with poor visibility.  An MCA spokeswoman said rescue teams had struggled in difficult conditions, and that police were with the boy's family who were \"distraught\".  Several other people have been injured by falling debris. London Ambulance said a man in his 40s was taken to hospital with a shoulder injury after a tree fell on his motorbike in south-west London.  Up to 220,000 homes suffered power cuts as St Jude's storm with winds of almost 100mph pushed across the South West, South, South East, the Midlands and the East of England, UK Power Networks said.  Falling trees and other debris covering railway tracks caused travel misery for thousands of commuters, with trains and London Underground services suspended.  A fallen tree blocks a road due to the overnight storm in Brighton, southern England  On the London Underground, only three lines - Victoria, Hammersmith & City and Waterloo & City - were operating normally through the morning rush-hour.  There were no trains at all running on London Overground, while there were part -suspensions on the Central, District, Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines.  Asked if the train companies had overreacted to the risk posed by the storm, the Prime Minister said it was important that decisions were based on the evidence.  He said: \"Everyone has to act on the basis of the evidence that they are given.\"  But he added: \"Obviously afterwards we will be able to look back and see whether people made the right decisions.  \"But right now what matters is listening to the evidence, working together and getting things back to normal.\"  The port of Dover in Kent had to shut, more than 130 flights at Heathrow Airport were cancelled and many roads were impassable due to fallen trees.  A tree blocks the pavement outside the disused Strand station, London  The weather forecaster who famously failed to forecast one of Britain's worst storms in living memory joked that people would say it served him right that today's wind blew down a tree in his garden.  Michael Fish - who told television viewers there was not a hurricane on the way hours before a huge storm ravaged parts of England in 1987 - said even his wife blamed him for the damage.  But he also hailed the accuracy of new computer models which he said had allowed the Met Office to predict the latest weather front and prevent \"horrendous loss of life\".  \"I had a phone call from my wife not so long ago and of course it was my fault that a tree has apparently gone down in my garden and over the neighbour's garage,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  \"So even I don't escape and I can hear some of you saying 'serves him right!'.\"  St Jude Storm - UK Weather 610\n",
      "Getty High winds and rain from Storm Desmond have battered Britain  Record amounts of rain have fallen in Cumbria, the worst-hit county, where many residents were evacuated and tens of thousands of properties left without power. The Met Office has issued a severe weather warning for rain this week as northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland brace themselves for more heavy downpours. Environment Secretary Liz Truss said there had been a \"number of weather-related fatalities\" and the severity of the weather was \"unprecedented\". While the Met Office's chief scientist Dame Julia Slingo said the extreme weather conditions were \"extraordinary\". She told BBC Radio 4's World At One: \"Is it to do with climate change? There can't yet be a definitive answer but we know that all the evidence from fundamental physics and what we understand about our weather patterns, that there is potentially a role.\" The link to global warming could increase pressure on the UK to make sure that a strong deal gets agreed in at the ongoing climate change summit in Paris. The Environment Agency has said that more than 5,200 homes and businesses have been flooded, with David Cameron visiting the worst-hit areas. The Deputy First Minister has pledged that Scottish councils will recieve government cash if they can show the flooding caused by Storm Desmond has caused a burden that could not have been accomodated in their local budgets. John Swinney is inviting applications for an emergency funding programme known as the Bellwin scheme, but has warned there is no automatic entitlement and local authorities are expected to include a small amount within their annual budget to deal with unforeseen emergencies.  AFP • Getty David Cameron has visited some areas affected by flooding  Over a thousand have been left homeless by the tragedy and one man has been found dead in a river. Heartbroken victims of the floods caused by Storm Desmond have been told it could take up to a year for their homes to become habitable again. Forecasters have warned another seven inches of rain is on its way. Already a record fall of 13 inches has hit the area in the last 24 hours. The water-levels in the worst affected areas have been continuing to rise. David Cameron has called up troops to help tackle the carnage wreaked by Storm Desmond which has also cut power to 60,000 properties. In badly-affected parts of Cumbria and the Scottish Borders more than 1,000 residents were ordered to leave their homes for their own safety as the Environment Agency issued a staggering 186 flood warnings. A body was found in the water near Kendal, Cumbria, a day after Police warned Carlisle residents to stay indoors and not to travel as emergency services dredged the border city’s River Kent.  roseparry.co.uk Floods have caused devastation in Cumbria  While in Northern Ireland a 70-year-old man died after his car got trapped in flood water.    The victim has been named as Ivan Vaughan from Caledon, County Tyrone.    The Government has said that it will 'look again' at flood defences following devastation caused by Storm Desmond as thousands of homes have been damaged. Officers, along with an underwater search team are working to recover the body. Storm Desmond has also has a massive impact on rail services in the north of England and Scotland with huge numbers of scheduled services simply abandoned. On Saturday a 90-year-old man lost his life after he was believed to have been blown into the side of a moving bus by a gust of wind, near Finchley Central Tube station, north London, a Scotland Yard spokesman said. The RSPCA has rescued 36 people from the flooding caused by the storm, as well as saving cats, dogs, rabbits and chickens.

People in parts of Appleby and Keswick, in the county were forced to leave their homes and shops with help from the police while others in the area are being told to stay with friends and family or head to shelters set up to advise and help those who have to evacuate. A group of five people had to be rescued from a house in Appleby, Cumbria, after they got trapped on the first floor by floodwater. Power supplies were also seriously affected and at least 55,000 homes in Lancaster, Morecambe and Carnforth will continue to face cuts for a number of days after flood defences protecting a major substation were breached overnight.  GETTY Rescuers battle floodwater in Carlisle  Hundreds of homes were hit ‘without warning’ according to people in a Cumbrian town who were relying on a two hour warning alarm. Residents in Appleby in Westmorland said the alarm that would have given them time to evacuate did not go off. Councillor Gareth Hayes, 55, said: “I can’t stop crying. \"There was no warning, it came up so quickly. “The siren didn’t sound, like it should have done, so we had less time to prepare.” Peter Thompson, 72, a former seaman also raised questions over its failure. “I’ve never sen it this bad and I saw the flooding in 1968. “The put these flood defences in all round and they’ve just not been enough.” Cumbria council leader Stuart Young called today for an investigation into adequacy of flood defences as families said they had not been protected.  Electricity North West said another 4,000 properties were without power across Cumbria as flooding continued to cause further faults. National Rail has said tickets for trains cancelled over the weekend will still be valid on Monday and Tuesday. Further flood warnings were issued in more than 60 areas and there are another 72 amber alerts urging people to prepare for the worst – with hundreds of rivers across the country already poised to burst their banks. This afternoon the Environment Agency confirmed the water levels in Cumbria are now higher in Keswick, Appleby and Kendal than they were in the 2009 floods.  GETTY Forecasters warn a month's worth of rain will fall in parts  Up to a month’s rain has been forecast over the next 48 hours. The violent Atlantic storm system has also caused landslides and power cuts in England and Scotland. Storm Desmond left 2,000 people in Ireland without power and caused several flight diversions. And around 200 homes in Yorkshire and more than 300 in Wales have also been left without power. A gust of 73mph was recorded as weather experts warn the worst is still to come. Winds will be strong enough to topple trees sparking warnings to take extra care while out and about in the coming days.    Although the north has so far experienced the worst of the weather, nowhere is escaping a hammering, with colossal waves being thrown over defences in coastal regions around the UK. Forecasters warned to expect severe gales while torrential downpours dump around four inches (100mm) of rain in a matter of hours.  Motorists Motorists have been warned of challenging roads amid flooding  The Met Office said the fourth named storm of the year - Desmond - correctly predicetd several rivers would burst their banks. Motorists have been urged to be aware of \"extremely challenging\" driving conditions, with flooding, wind damage and landslide debris over roads. The RAC has reported a 50 per cent spike in one day at the weekend. A spokesman said: \"Motorists encountering flood water on the road should think twice before trying to drive through. \"If you are at all unsure how deep a flood is the best advice is to err on the side of caution and take another route.\"  Getty Images Major Incident Declared As Storm Desmond Wreaks Havoc In Cumbria  Storm Imogen hits the UK with 96mph winds Tue, February 9, 2016 Storm Imogen causes havoc across the UK, bringing severe flooding and gail force winds to Britain.

Vulnerable people are being evacuated from 2,200 homes in York, where people in 3,500 properties near the River Foss have been advised to be ready to leave.  Six severe flood warnings - indicating a danger to life - are in place.  Met Office warnings of further rainfall are in place for northern England, Scotland and Wales.  In total, hundreds of flood alerts and warnings have been issued - more than 30 of them severe.  Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: \"My thoughts are with people whose homes have been flooded.  \"I'll chair a COBRA [emergency committee] call [on Sunday] to ensure everything is being done to help.\"  In pictures: North of England flooding  The River Irwell and River Roch have both overflowed, causing flooding in Salford, Manchester city centre and Rochdale.  Roads in central Leeds, where a severe warning is in place on the River Aire, are also under water.  Rest centres  Red Cross volunteers are working in three rest centres in Chorley, Salford and Bury. A spokeswoman said there were more than 50 people at the centre in Bury.  In York, people in the most-at-risk properties near the River Foss, a tributary of the River Ouse, have been advised by the Environment Agency to move valuable belongings upstairs and to prepare to be evacuated.  BBC north of England correspondent Danny Savage said on Saturday: \"Everywhere I have been in Yorkshire today, whether people have lived there for 15 or 50 years, they have said the same thing to me - in their lifetime, they have never seen flooding like this.\"  BBC Weather forecaster Alex Deakin said the heavy rain would move southwards after midnight, leaving drier conditions in northern England.  While there would be more rain in the north during Sunday, it would not be as intense or prolonged as the downpours on Saturday, he added.  In other developments on Saturday:  Two Met Office red warnings for rain were issued for parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire, but they have now expired  There are seven severe flood warnings in Lancashire - meaning flooding is expected and there is a danger to life - and 24 in Yorkshire  Houses in Mytholmroyd, West Yorkshire, and in Ribchester and Whalley, Lancashire, were evacuated after rivers burst their banks  Electricity North West has warned power may not be restored to some homes until Monday.

Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss, who announced a review of flood defences earlier this month, said the priority \"continues to be protecting lives, protecting homes and protecting businesses\".  Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Guy Shrubsole said the record rainfall and repeated flooding in December were a sign of changing climate and highlighted the need for greater action by the government.  Local Government Association environment spokesman Peter Box said councils were \"pulling out all the stops\" to find accommodation for those forced to leave their homes amid flooding.  \"Storms in Cumbria and Lancashire have reminded us just how unforgiving and formidable nature can be but councils in the regions have worked hard to try and minimise the impact on residents,\" he added.

      "The Colby Fire continues to burn through the night in Glendora, Ca.  Jan. 17, 2014 The Colby Fire continues to burn through the night in Glendora, Ca. David McNew/Reuters  The fire burns near the residential community of Glendora in the San Gabriel Valley, 25 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles. Mandatory evacuations have been ordered as unseasonably warm weather, dry conditions and the infamous Santa Ana winds have combined to spread the flames.  The fire burns near the residential community of Glendora in the San Gabriel Valley, just 25 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.  The fire burns near the residential community of Glendora in the San Gabriel Valley, just 25 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.  The Colby fire continues to burn outside the communities of Glendora and Azusa, about 25 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, but officials announced Thursday evening that the fire’s forward spread had stopped. Some evacuation orders remain in effect as firefighters hope to take advantage of calmer winds Friday.  The fire caught sometime before dawn Thursday morning and had burned 1,709 acres by Thursday night, consuming five residences as well as other structures. The fire is named for a trail where it is believed to have started.  Three men were arrested in connection with the fire Thursday. Glendora police accused them of starting a campfire that quickly spread out of control, according to the Los Angeles Times.  About 3,600 people were evacuated Thursday, but about half of them have been allowed to return to their homes. The perimeter of the fire is 30 percent contained, according to data from the Forest Service. Several hundred firefighters are working to contain the flames.  The National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning through this evening for the Sierra Nevada and the coast of Southern California as far as the Mexican border, indicating a high risk of fire. The service cited unseasonably warm and dry weather at the end of an unusually arid year that has desiccated fuels in the state’s wildlands.  Humidity could fall as low as 3 percent in Los Angeles on Friday, and forecasters anticipate gusts of 40 mph in the valleys. The temperature is expected to reach 84 degrees.

      "Areas around the state lines of South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota, as well as parts of Nebraska, have seen massive amounts of rainfall over the last few days, causing severe flooding. A state of emergency has been declared in South Dakota and in Iowa. Around 400 people have been evacuated in northwest Iowa. Homes and property have been damaged and some roads, including the Interstate 29, have been closed. The area has also been hit by storms, strong wind and hail.  Storms and Tornadoes  The heavy rainfall and storms are part of a weather system that earlier this week brought tornadoes to Pilger in Nebraska, where one person died and 19 were injured people. The town itself sustained extensive damage, with a reportedly 50-70% of buildings and infrastructure damaged or destroyed. The storms and torrential rainfall of Monday and Tuesday were followed by a tornado warnings for parts of South Dakota late Tuesday 17 June 2014. Initial reports claim homes have been destroyed by a tornado in the small town of Humboldt in Minnehaha County, South Dakota.  South Dakota State of Emergency  Flooding has been severe in some areas, in particular Sioux Fall, South Dakota, where Governor Dennis Daugaard declared a state of emergency on Tuesday 17 June 2014.  Canton, south Dakota, was also badly hit by flooding. In fact flooding was so bad, the Interstate 29 near the Canton exit had to be closed during the evening of16 June 2014. Flood water was so high it reached the headlights of cars trapped on the highway. Interstate 29 re-opened early the next day.  For some time during Monday and Tuesday, the small city of Canton was cut off from the outside world by flood water. The flooding spread across the area, affecting Harrisburg, South Dakota, and the wider areas of Lincoln and Turner counties.  Rainfall Totals 24 Hours 16 to 17 June 2014  Minnesota  Lakefield Mines- 3.29 inches  Iowa  Peterson – 5.14 inches  Sibley – 4.10  Orange City – 3.49  Sioux City Airport – 3.12  South Dakota  Sioux Falls – 3.00 inches  Centerville – 2.95  Rainfall amounts. Image from National weather service  (figures and image from National Weather Service)  June Rainfall Records  So far Sioux Falls has seen 9.97 inches of rain fall in June this year, which beats the previous record of 8.43 inches set in 1984 and we still have 12 more days until the end of the month.  Evacuations and State of Emergency in Iowa  Flooding was also seen in southern Minnesota and northwest Iowa. Around 350 people had to evacuate their homes in Alvord, Lyon County on Monday 16 June.  Some of the worst affected areas of Iowa were those along the Rock River, where high levels are threatening some communities in the area, particularly in Rock Rapids and Rock Valley.  RT @ArgusMWalker: Just one of the areas flooded in Rock Valley. pic.twitter.com/GBN8M8TXZW — ArgusLeader911 (@Argus911) June 17, 2014  On Monday the Rock River levels stood at more than 24 feet. The highest level on record stands at 28 feet from 1993. Around 70 people had to evacuate their homes in Rock Valley on Monday 16 June. The Red Cross has set up temporary accommodation for the displaced and a state of emergency has been declared.  There have also been some reports that a levee in Rock valley broke, leaving the town facing further flooding. Thousands of volunteers were placing sandbags and emergency flood defences to help protect homes and property in the area.  Sources: Argus Leader 631\n",
      "Event Narrative  A tornado formed along a squall line west of Platteville, just south of County Road B, and traveled through Memorial Park on to the Univ. of Wisconsin - Platteville campus. Five people were injured, one of them seriously. There was extensive damage done to five buildings and the stadium on campus. Roofs of two new residential halls were partially destroyed and a third residential hall was also damaged along with one academic building. Two large lighting structures at the football stadium were knocked over, with one crashing across the bleachers causing the concrete foundation underneath the bleachers to be substantially moved. Damage continued into nearby homes and businesses as the tornado tracked across Business Highway 151. The top level of a split level home was ripped off one house, another house lost part of a roof and a porch while several other homes had windows blown out and trees knocked down. A gas station/convenience store was leveled by the tornado where it also ripped a pump out of the ground and blew over a semi. Numerous other business and vehicles suffered blown out windows. After hitting a cemetery on the south side of town, the tornado dissipated just before reaching U.S. Highway 151 southeast of town. A total of 12 homes were destroyed with another 20 damaged.  At UW-Platteville, the tornado caused $7.3 million in damage to Bridgeway Commons, $4.8 million in damage to Rountree Commons and $1.8 million to Southwest Hall. All three buildings are dorms.  The tornado caused $1.8 million in damage to Engineering Hall, a classroom building, and $1.7 million in damage to the stadium. 632\n",
      "Another Month, Another Couple of Towns Wiped Out by Tornadoes  By John Lawrence  June 2014 was one of the worst months on record for extreme weather. Tuesday June 3 saw baseball size hail, 100 mph wind gusts and 11 tornadoes in South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri. In Omaha and Des Moines there were hundreds of reports of hail. Trees toppled on autos. Wind damage was mostly from derecchio winds. Derecchio winds are straight line winds which can be as damaging as tornadoes.  In Blair, Nebraska, officials said nearly every home, as well as any car that was parked outdoors, was damaged. The courthouse alone sustained more than $1.2 million in damage because, after hail shattered windows and skylights, rain penetrated inside. The insurance price tag in Nebraska and western Iowa will soar into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Although a handful of tornadoes were reported, baseball-sized hail and flooding rains left the biggest mark.  Blair resident, Donna Jones, said she saw widespread damage when she went to work Wednesday morning. “Everybody is in a daze,” Jones said. “There’s not a house that isn’t touched.” The Woodhouse Auto Family, which owns car dealerships in both Iowa and Nebraska, said on Facebook that about 4,500 vehicles were damaged across their properties. Hoods were dented and windshields were shattered. Company officials Wednesday estimated damages at $162 million. Hail smashed house windows and damaged siding. Police in Blair said 20 people were taken to the hospital with injuries. In several other cities, streets were flooded and trees were knocked down. Power was out.  By Thursday June 5th power outages remained across portions of Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee following strong winds associated with the storms Wednesday night and Thursday morning. More than 6.8 inches of rain fell in two hours early Thursday morning at Centerville, Tennessee, as a flash flood warning was posted for the area.  Omaha, Nebraska, had its wettest June day in history on Tuesday, breaking a 139-year-old record with 5.30 inches of rain and single-handedly wiping out its rainfall deficit for 2014.  By Thursday roof damage was reported in Lindsborg, Kansas, where 90-mph winds were estimated behind an area of decaying thunderstorms. Baseball-size hail was reported in at least two locations in Kansas. The storms then tore across the Ozarks before reintensifying over northeast Arkansas, where at least one building was destroyed by straight-line derecchio winds.  On June 16 tornadoes in Nebraska killed at least one person. 16 others were taken to hospital in critrical condition. At least 2 tornadoes touched down, one a mile wide.  Also on that day there were wildfires near Bakersfield, CA. Gusty winds were not helping. Three and a half square miles burned. Five hundred homes were evacuated.  The Tiny Town Too Tough to Die  On June 18 twin tornadoes ripped through Pilger, Nebraska.There were two EF-4 tornadoes with 200 mph wind speeds. The total devastation belied the town’s motto, “The tiny town too tough to die.” The rare twin tornadoes wiped out the town’s business district, obliterated its fire station and ground 40 or 50 homes into rubble, Stanton County Sheriff Mike Unger said. The City Hall, Public Library, Fire Department and Midwest Bank were gone. As much as three quarters of the town of 350 is gone. Two people died during the storm including a five year old girl.  On the same day that Pilger was destroyed, a tornado damaged more than 40 houses and dozens of businesses in Wessington Springs, South Dakota. The same system that brought devastating tornadoes to Pilger, Nebraska and Wessington Springs, South Dakota doused parts of South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska and Illinois leading to historic flooding in some areas. After a week of heavy rains and rising waters, the floods that have developed in the Midwest had become deadly.  Also on June 18 California banned open burning on 31 million acres. There have been more than 2000 wildfires this year in California, 70% more than average. At the same time temperatures around 100 degrees F were recorded in Philadelphia and Washington, DC. Fire on a Navajo reservation burned 19 square miles on the Arizona and New Mexico border.  In Minnesota a state of emergency was declared in 35 counties on June 19 after days of heavy rain led to widespread flooding. Minneapolis set a record for the wettest June since record keeping began 140 years ago. Homes in over half the counties in the state of Minnesota have been impacted by flooding. In just 8 hours 6 inchs of rain fell in the St Paul/Minneapolis area. More than 25 inches of rain have fallen so far this June in the twin cities area. In Saint Paul the Mississippi River is at 20 feet – 6 feet above flood stage. Rivers will be at flood stage till after the 4th of July and beyond if rain continues to fall. Farm losses in Minnesota are at $7 Million so far. Mudslides threatened a hospital in Saint Paul.  Farm fields are under water, roads have been washed out, dams have failed and water has infiltrated homes from the far north to the far south of Minnesota. Four state parks have been fully or partially closed because of high water. “The damage is really unprecedented and very widespread,” Gov. Mark Dayton said before boarding a plane to southern Minnesota along with U.S. Sens. Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar.  Damage assessments already total in the millions even before surveying can start in many places soaked by downpours over the past week. Some lakes and rivers swelled to record levels, with others not expected to crest for days, if not weeks.  Record Rainfall, Record Floods, States of Emergency Declared  Gov. Daugaard declared a state of emergency for South Dakota on Tuesday. Daugaard also ordered the opening of the State Emergency Operations Center to monitor the effects of the torrential rains and coordinate the state’s response. The Red Cross also opened an emergency shelter to help people who have been evacuated or can’t reach their homes because of the flooding.  Sioux Falls, South Dakota obliterated its previous wettest month on record, 9.42 inches in May 1898, taking only half the month to do it. Through June 21, 13.39 inches of rain had soaked Sioux Falls, which is over half the average yearly precipitation of 26.38 inches. Sioux City, Iowa, broke its wettest month on record Friday, and by Sunday, Sioux City’s total had reached 13.25 inches, well above the old single-month record of 11.78 inches in May 1903.  Along the South Dakota-Iowa border, the town of Canton, South Dakota, was hit hard by flooding earlier in the week, and many homes were destroyed.  “I have nothing left. It’s all gone,” said Canton resident Dale Larson.  Within a 24-hour time span between Monday morning and Tuesday morning (June 22), 8.43 inches of rain was measured in Canton, about 20 miles southeast of Sioux Falls. According to the National Weather Service, this was the third highest 24-hour precipitation total in state history, narrowly missing the all-time record of 8.74 inches on May 6, 2007 in Groton.  The flooding stretched over the border into western Iowa, where Rock Rapids and Rock Valley have been partially evacuated. In Rock Rapids, about 60 homes have had water waist deep or higher, Mayor Jason Chase said, and many have shifted from their foundations or have damaged basement walls.  “This is the worst I’ve seen and I’ve been here since 1997,” he said. Several families remain in a Red Cross shelter, Chase said.  Gov. Terry Branstad and Iowa Homeland Security and Emergency Management Department Director Mark Schouten surveyed damage in Rock Rapids and Rock Valley on Wednesday.  Rock Valley, about 20 miles southwest of Rock Rapids, requested pumps and sandbagging materials from the state after a levee broke on Tuesday night. The river is receding, but a local shelter still is available for residents needing to leave their homes.  The Big Sioux River set record flood levels at Hawarden and Akron where it peaked Tuesday. A levee also was breached in Akron, causing several residents to be evacuated late Tuesday night and early Wednesday. The city pumped out floodwaters to protect City Hall and other buildings.  Downstream, the Omaha Public Power District said it will reduce power as it prepares for rising water on the Missouri River. The district’s Fort Calhoun nuclear power plant sits about 20 miles north of Omaha, and was surrounded by water during flooding three years ago.  In southern Wisconsin, a line of thunderstorms that spawned twisters rolled through late Monday and early Tuesday. The town of Madison was hit hard. Mayor Paul Soglin said about 25 homes were damaged by the storm, which caused about $10 million in damages.  The National Weather Service said it appeared a tornado touched down and lifted several times in the Mineral Point and Verona areas. At least 19 homes in Verona, near Madison, were damaged so badly they were uninhabitable. The weather service said two tornadoes touched down in Plateville.  Some parts of the Midwest — including parts of Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, and Nebraska — received 5 to 10 inches of rain over the course of a week, an amount that’s the equivalent of two months of rainfall in the region. In Minnesota, the rain caused mudslides and forced evacuations.  “Right now what we’re seeing is a statewide disaster, really,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said Sunday. “From International Falls on the Canadian border down to Luverne on the Iowa border, it really covered the whole state.”  The rain has damaged corn and soybean crops, according to local reports, with water slow to drain from farmers’ fields. If farmers can get the water off their crops over the next few days, the crops could survive, and soybeans can be replanted this late in the season. The rains also elevated river levels, which could temporarily halt grain shipments in the region.  As rains soak the Midwest, California is parched, with 100 percent of the state in the most severe stages of drought. California Gov. Jerry Brown linked the state’s epic drought and ramped-up wildfire season to climate change last month, saying that the severe weather patterns prove that “humanity is on a collision course with nature.”  Science has shown that climate change will exacerbate — and likely already is exacerbating — heavy rainfall and drought conditions throughout the U.S. These events are sometimes sequential: long periods of drought can be followed by torrential downpours, making it difficult for the parched soil to absorb the rain and leading to flooding.  As the month ended, the midwest was continuing to experience more torrential rain, flooding, damaging winds, tornadoes and hail. The worst was not over. 633\n",

      "When the smoke cleared from a new wildfire threatening the small Columbia River Gorge community of Rowena, area residents glimpsed an even less-welcome sight – a line of flames visible from the city of the Dalles, about six miles away.  After the fire made a run along the river Wednesday evening, residents of 275 homes in Rowena were told to evacuate, fire spokesman Dave Wells said.  Residents of nearly 90 homes in an outlying subdivision of the Dalles, a city of about 14,000, were told to be ready to leave if necessary, Wells said.  Firefighters planned to work through the night protecting structures.  No homes had burned as of Wednesday night, the spokesman said.  Five helicopters dropped water on the blaze Wednesday as winds gusted to more than 30mph, fire spokesman Justin de Ruyter said.  A section of US Highway 30 was closed in the area, but Interstate 84 remained open. Rowena is about 75 miles east of Portland.  The fire began in brush Tuesday night and quickly spread to about 200 acres of timber and scrub oak in rocky, steep terrain that is home to rattlesnakes, ticks and poison oak.  “We’ve got a challenging fire on our hands,” de Ruyter said.  Governor John Kitzhaber invoked the state’s authority to mobilize local fire departments to protect buildings, and structural protection fire crews have come from three counties.  The governor also toured Oregon’s biggest wildfire, the Oregon Gulch fire, which burned six homes last week in the Siskiyou Mountains along the California border about 15 miles east of Ashland. It was 37% contained at 57 sq miles. While in fire camp, he called on Congress to pay for more forest-thinning projects to reduce the risk of wildfires.  “These fires are a symptom of a much larger forest health issue,” he said. “We just have to begin to deal with the root causes. That means lending some urgency to improving the health and resiliency of our forests in a way that can produce jobs.”  US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack this week said the US Forest Service will soon have to start pulling funding from thinning projects and other programs to pay for the continued battle against wildfires.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Firefighters try to stop the spreading of the Eiler Fire from moving closer to Burney, California. Photograph: Andreas Fuhrmann/AP  In all, there are 10 large fires in Oregon, with nearly 4,000 people fighting them across 143 sq miles of timber and rangeland. The cost to date exceeds $36.7m.  The north-west has been at fire preparedness level five – the top level – since 16 July, and the season still has a long way to go, said Tom Knappenberger, a spokesman at the federal interagency fire center in Portland.  • In Washington, fire spokesmen say a wildfire burning on the Colville Indian Reservation in the northeastern part of the state has scorched about 7,000 acres.  Residents of about 25 homes have been told to evacuate in the face of the Devil’s Elbow Complex of three wildfires. Detected Sunday, those fires were likely ignited by lightning.  Fire spokeswoman Karen Ripley said late Wednesday that no homes have burned. About 210 firefighters are attacking the flames.  The Snag Canyon wildfire near Ellensburg in central Washington has grown to 6,400 acres and is being fought by about 450 firefighters.  The Washington incident management team reports that fire was started by lightning on Saturday and is burning through grass, brush and timber about 12 miles north-west of Ellensburg. The fire has destroyed eight homes.  • In California, light rain and an infusion of personnel and equipment from as far away as San Diego allowed fire crews to continue gaining momentum Wednesday on a pair of wildfires that exploded over the weekend in northern California and have burned more than 110 square miles, officials said. The two fires burning about seven miles apart in Shasta and Lassen counties were among nine major wildfires that erupted in a 24-hour period last week, most sparked by lightning.  Eight homes, a historic post office and a restaurant were lost in the smaller of the two fires that started in Lassen National Forest and threatened Burney, a town of about 3,000 people in Shasta County. An evacuation advisory for Burney was lifted on Tuesday.  The spread of the second blaze had also slowed enough that people living in its path were allowed to return home on Tuesday afternoon. 636\n",
      "About 2,500 people were stranded after thunderstorms caused mountain mudslides in Southern California, while one person was found dead in a flooded creek Sunday, authorities said.The mudslides swallowed cars, campers and vans.One person was killed after swift-moving floods swept their car away, authorities said.The stranded included 500 children and adults who had arrived at a Forest Falls, California, campground Sunday morning.\"Our concern is that they're isolated at that campground and no longer have access out of the mountain,\" San Bernardino County Fire spokesman Kyle Hauducoeur said.The debris flow engulfed one home. Emergency crews rescued the home's resident.\"The rain in this area, at times, was the equivalent of what you would see from a major hurricane,\" Hauducoeur said.The storm moved in quickly, snapping trees and sending a torrent of water rushing through the region. In Forest Falls, a wall of mud as high as 15 feet and up to 75 feet wide was reported.In Mount Baldy, rescuers broke the windows of a car trapped underwater, making sure no one was inside. The vehicle was empty, a small shred of hope amid the devastation witnessed by residents such as Michael Scully.\"This is the worst we've had since at least 1969,\" Scully said.Monsoonal moisture brought brief but fierce storms to mountain, desert and inland areas. In and around Palm Springs, knee-deep water flooded city streets and stranded vehicles. In the city of Redlands, the storm downed a tree and knocked out power to a few neighborhoods.Authorities made reverse 911 calls to urge residents to stay put while crews cleared the roads with bulldozers.All the water was desperately needed elsewhere in the state. In northern and central California, firefighters battled more than a dozen fires. Crews created a six-mile fire line to protect the town of Burney.\"I have a lot of confidence in our brothers and sisters that we'll all come out of this OK,\" Burney Fire Department Chief Ray Barber said. 637\n",

      "CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A powerful earthquake rattled through Northern California early Sunday morning, leaving dozens wounded and thousands without power. It is the strongest temblor to hit the Napa Valley area in nearly 25 years. VPC  A man uses a garden hose cool hot spots from a fire at a mobile home park following a 6.0 earthquake on Aug. 24, 2014 in Napa, Calif. (Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images)    NAPA, Calif. — A strong earthquake that rocked Northern California's scenic Napa wine country early Sunday injured more than 100 people, sent brick and concrete tumbling from historic buildings and triggered fires and power outages.  Officials said at least 15 buildings were left uninhabitable, and many more awaited further evaluation. State transportation officials inspected highways and bridges and declared them safe for travel.  The magnitude-6.0 earthquake struck around 3:20 a.m.. For some residents, the temblor revived memories of the last big quake to strike the San Francisco Bay Area 25 years ago, which did major damage.  Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for Napa, Solano, and Sonoma counties. Schools in Napa Valley were ordered closed Monday.  Mike Parness, city manager, said 15 or 16 buildings in the central downtown were \"red tagged\" after inspectors found damage left them too dangerous for people to enter. Several dozen other buildings were awaiting further evaluation.  \"We've got a lot of workers out checking out homes and buildings,'' Parness said.  In the city's downtown section, a 10-foot chunk of brick and concrete was shaken from the corner of the old county courthouse building. Big pieces of rubble littered the lawn and street in front of the building.  Largest Napa quake since Loma Prieta  The quake was centered near American Canyon about 6 miles southwest of Napa, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. It's the largest quake to hit the Napa Valley region near San Francisco since the Loma Prieta temblor in 1989.  At least three people were reported in critical condition following quake injuries, officials said. One of them, a 13-year-old boy injured by a falling fireplace, was airlifted to the University of California-Davis hospital for surgery.  Jack LaRochelle, public works director of the city of about 77,000 people, said 30 water mains were broken and requiring repairs.  After the initial shock wore off, an almost festive air prevailed in the city with tourists on rented bicycles riding through closed streets. At one point so many people were sending photos from their mobile phones that cellular systems were overwhelmed.  Most of the heavily damaged buildings were in the older, central area of town. Newer homes and buildings away from the center of city city suffered less damage, but many were without power, officials said.    That lack of power meant some residents who rely on well water were unable to get water.  John Furtado headed into Napa to look for water. \"But we're doing fine overall. It's just some minor damage. A couple bottles of wine broke,'' he said.  Many injured during clean-up  Kelly Huston, a deputy director with the California Office of Emergency Services, said there were no reports of fatalities, but dozens were taken to local hospitals. Most injuries, he anticipated, would be from falling objects and debris.    Napa's local hospital, Queen of the Valley Medical Center, treated 172 patients Sunday and admitted 13, CEO Walt Mickens said. Most were treated for cuts and bruises, while at least three were admitted for broken bones and two for heart attacks.  \"Now it appears we're treating people (injured while) cleaning up,\" hospital spokeswoman Vanessa deGier said Sunday afternoon.  CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share As Napa, California business owners look over the damage, they say this is worse than the 1989 earthquake that hit the area. A magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit the Napa Valley early Sunday morning.  Huston said several fires were burning in the area of the quake and that the state was dispatching urban search and rescue teams \"much like we would on a wildfire.\" He said state officials would do a flyover shortly to assess damage. Further inspections could reveal more damage, he warned.  Six structure fires were reported, John Callanan, Napa fire chief, said. In one of those fires, four mobile homes were destroyed.  64,000 without power  At least 64,000 people were without power at some point, state emergency officials said. By evening power had been restored to all but 17,000 customers, according to Pacific Gas & Electric, the largest power provider in the area.  CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Firefighters in the Napa Valley worked fast to slow home fires after arriving on scene to find water main breaks had damaged their ability to get water on the fires. VPC  Napa Police Capt. Steve Potter said the area's 911 system was briefly overwhelmed by calls that came in shortly after the quake, but the system quickly came back.  There were no reported highway blockages, though Huston said there was a report of a buckled offramp on state Highway 72 at Sonoma.  Napa is a picturesque town known for its lush vineyards, robust wines and rolling hills. There was no electricity downtown early Sunday as residents walked looking for damage. On Second Street, the masonry, wires and girders that make up the corner of the roof of a three-story historic building hung precariously over the sidewalk. A gaping hole was left where the masonry used to be. On the ground below a pile of bricks and rubble littered the sidewalk. Falling concrete damaged trees.  The historic Napa Valley Courthouse lost a portion of its roof, and police blocked off sections of the downtown to keep crowds away from the debris. Two other historical buildings — the Sam Kee Laundry, the Goodman Library — were also damaged.  ​  The state has not requested federal assistance, as it was still evaluating the damage, Brad Alexander, chief of media relations for California's Office of Emergency Services, said.  \"My Office of Emergency Services has been on full activation since early this morning and is working closely with state and local emergency managers, first responders and transportation officials to respond to impacts to residents and critical infrastructure,\" the governor said in a statement. \"These public safety officials are doing all they can to help residents and those living in affected areas should follow their guidance and instruction.\"  Douglas Edwards, 27, Napa resident, said the earthquake woke him up from a sound sleep.  'It was just flash, flash, flash'  \"It was shaking so hard I was barely able to get myself and my daughter out,\" he said. \"When I stood up, the floor moved so much, I fell back down again. I ran outside and you could see the transformers exploding in the sky. It was just flash, flash, flash.\"  Napa County Supervisor Bill Dodd inspected damage at the Napa County administration building Sunday morning.  \"It's devastated in there,\" he said. Ceilings collapsed, furniture scattered and file cabinets were upturned and on the floor. Dodd said normally the building would have been the site of emergency services coordination, however, because of the damage, emergency operations were moved to the sheriff's office in the southern part of the county.  \"It'll be some time before we can go back to work in there,\" he said.  Dodd said the historic three-story Winship building, which lost a corner of its roof, looks to be a total loss. He said it had been completely renovated 10 years ago, and the renovation included a seismic upgrade, which is supposed to make buildings able to withstand an earthquake.  In the city of Sonoma, west of Napa, police and fire officials reported no significant damage or injuries from the earthquake, officials said on the city's website. It said they had no information from PG&E about when power would be restored to those homes and businesses experiences outages.  The quake — which occurred at a depth of just less than 7 miles — was felt as far north as Sacramento and as far south as Santa Cruz and was immediately followed by a series of small aftershocks.  9 million feel shaking  According to USGS, nearly nine million people were estimated to have been exposed to varying levels of ground shaking.  It remains too early to provide a specific economic or insured loss estimate at this time, according to Aon Benfield, a reinsurance firm. However, the USGS's automated economic loss software predicted that there was a 27% chance that economic losses will end up beyond $1 billion, and a 35% chance that economic losses will top $100 million.  The USGS said the quake is likely to produce 30 to 70 small aftershocks with magnitude 3 to 5 within the next week. The probability of a strong and possibly damaging aftershock with a magnitude of 5 or greater in the next week is 54%, the USGS said.  The quake is the strongest temblor to hit the USA outside Alaska this year, according to USGS. About five quakes of this magnitude or stronger hit the USA each year, many in or near Alaska.

      "GLENDORA (CBSLA.com) — The city of Glendora Thursday raised its alert level to red triggering a mandatory evacuation order due to the approaching storm.  The red alert went into effect at 10 p.m. as did the evacuation order for more than 1,000 residents living in the Colby Fire burn-area, officials said.  The city said the Crowther Teen Center at 241 W. Dawson is open.  “We recommend evacuations and the evacuations are mandatory. It doesn’t mean we’re going to go into their residences and force them to leave but we’re going to strongly advise that for their safety they should leave their residence. There is nothing they can do,” said Chief Tim Staab of the Glendora Police Department.  Officials also said the Inland Valley Humane Society will be available to offer assistance with small animals. If necessary, horses may be taken to the Pomona Fairgrounds, Gate 1.  “If the Colby Fire didn’t happen, all the flood control basins and debris basins would be doing their job. The fire is what caused all that,” said Vic Penrod with the Glendora Water Department.  Since the fire 11 months ago, three rainstorms have hit the area.  Pat Kozak, a Glendora resident, said he was expecting the worst.  “Last time, I wasn’t prepared so when it came down at 2 in the morning, I was running outside because we had such an inundation of water,” Kozak explained of a previous storm.  On Thursday, rocks, mud and sediment were being cleared out from the five debris basins located at the base of the burned-out hills.  By afternoon, a long-reach excavator was positioned near one of the storm channels in the event that debris blocks the free-flow of water. Across the region, K-rails and sandbags were in place.  “They have everything in place. As much as can be done is done and their just waiting for it to happen,” Penrod said.  Beginning at midnight, work crews are also expected to be positioned at all five debris basins to ensure that storm channels remain clear.

      "Emergencias preparan evacuación de cientos de familias  El río Uruguay no para de crecer y enciende alarmas  Ayer el río Uruguay tuvo otro repunte. Lentamente el nivel de las aguas comienza a alcanzar las llamadas \"cotas de seguridad\"; se trata de marcas que al ser superadas obligan a la evacuación de cientos de familias de Artigas, Paysandú y Salto.  mar oct 7 2014  Anoche, frente a las costas de Salto, la marca se situó en los 11,40 metros en la escala situada frente al puerto. En las inundaciones de julio una familia fue evacuada cuando la marca llegó a los 11,50 metros.  Mientras tanto, el lago de la represa de Salto Grande se mantenía ayer en los 32 metros de altura de acuerdo al programa de regulación de crecida que han implementado los técnicos de la Comisión Técnico Mixta (CTM) que lo gestiona.  El plan es amortiguar un caudal estimado de 24.000 metros cúbicos que se avecinan producto de las intensas precipitaciones ocurridas en territorio brasileño.  En la ciudad de Salto, además de las cuatro familias que se habían auto evacuados el pasado domingo, ayer por la tarde el Comité Departamental de Emergencia comenzó a actuar en otros casos. Se debió ayudar a seis personas, cuatro mayores y dos menores, al inundarse su vivienda. Pasaron a ser alojados en el Gimnasio Arnoldo Bernasconi, según indicó el coordinador, Sergio Acuña.  El informe diario que brinda la Comisión Técnica Mixta de Salto Grande establece que para los próximos días el nivel de esta nueva crecida podría alcanzar los 12,30 metros en el puerto de Salto el próximo miércoles, dado que se esperan más lluvias en la cuenca inmediata y media del río Uruguay.  Ayer por la tarde funcionarios de instituciones deportivas como el Club remeros y Salto Rowing comenzaron a retirar elementos de sus depósitos y a dejar libre a las aguas sus instalaciones de planta baja a la vez que los mini grill instalados en la costa hacían lo propio.  La zona portuaria ya está cubierta por la aguas y el desborde del río se explaya en la planta urbana por la calle 19 de Abril en donde hoy puede desalojar a algunas familias y talleres que funcionan en el lugar.  En Paysandú esperan tener pocos evacuados. El panorama podría llegar a complicarse si finalmente se cumple el pronóstico de intensas lluvias a la altura de Paso de los Libres (Corrientes, Argentina) para el próximo jueves.  Emilio Pérez, coordinador del Comité de Emergencia sanducero, informó a El País que el río ayer en la tarde se encontraba en 4,80 metros y crecía a razón de 3 centímetros en la hora.  \"Entre miércoles y jueves el río alcanzará una altura máxima de 6,50 metros\", indicó el funcionario que está en contacto con las autoridades de la represa de Salto Grande, responsables de administrar el caudal del río Uruguay.  En la creciente anterior con ese nivel fueron evacuadas por precaución unas 40 personas y otras 200 resolvieron autoevacuarse. \"La estimación era que el río superara la barrera de los 8 metros, razón por la cual mucha gente salió antes previendo que el agua alcanzaría sus viviendas, hecho que después no ocurrió\".  Pérez sostuvo que siempre y cuando \"no se registren nuevas precipitaciones, ésta vez (los evacuados) serán realmente muy pocos y por prevención pero si llueve mucho se podría complicar\", aseguró Pérez.  En Bella Unión las autoridades locales tienen todo dispuesto para evacuar a las familias que viven en la ribera del río Uruguay cuyas fincas serán alcanzadas por el agua en las próximas horas, según los datos manejados por las autoridades departamentales que integran el Comité de Emergencias.  Las previsiones establecen que la cota del río llegará a 7,90 metros lo que obligará a evacuar a unas 160 personas. No obstante, se estima que en esta ocasión el nivel de afectados será sensiblemente menor al de la anterior inundación.  En la mañana de ayer lunes se reunieron autoridades locales de distintos organismos públicos con Juan Eguillor, coordinador departamental de emergencias. Allí se estimó que será alrededor de medio centenar el número de familias que deberán abandonar sus hogares por efecto de la crecida.  Los evacuados serán trasladados a casas de familiares. También se maneja la posibilidad de alojarlos en el Club Náutico ya que esta vez el agua no llegaría a la sede de esa institución deportiva.  Ya está resuelto que la alimentación será elaborada por el Ejército Nacional y los víveres los aportará el Instituto Nacional de Alimentación (INDA).  Producción: Freddy Fernández (Artigas); D. Rojas (Paysandú); Luis Pérez (Salto). 661\n"

      "El nivel del Río Uruguay bajó en Artigas y en Salto y se mantiene estable en Paysandú. Casi no ha habido variaciones en el número de personas evacuadas y autoevacuadas. Se continúa desarrollando con normalidad el operativo retorno en el departamento de Artigas.  Actualmente hay 2.322 personas evacuadas y 21.249 autoevacuadas, totalizando 23.571 personas desplazadas.  De las 2.322 personas evacuadas, 1306 se encuentran en Artigas, 60 en Bella Unión, 404 en Paysandú, 19 en San Javier y 533 en Salto.  De las 21.249 personas autoevacuadas, 9239 se encuentran en Artigas, 397 en Bella Unión, 6304 en Paysandú, 38 en el departamento de Río Negro y 5271 en Salto.  De las 23.571 personas desplazadas, 10.545 se encuentran en Artigas, 457 en Bella Unión, 6708 en Paysandú, 57 en Río Negro y 5804 en Salto.  El aumento del número total de personas desplazadas no se debe a que haya más personas fuera de sus viviendas, sino a que, hay más personas autoevacuadas que se registraron en los respectivos CECOED.  En el siguiente cuadro figura el nivel del río y el detalle de personas evacuadas, autoevacuadas y desplazadas por departamento:  Acciones de respuesta  Todo el Estado en sus tres niveles de gobierno, trabaja en forma articulada para brindar atención integral a las familias afectadas. Esto es: resguardo, protección, alimentación, recreación y salud.  Respecto al servicio de salud, se realizan rondas médicas diarias y se lleva adelante el monitoreo epidemiológico.  Los servicios de agua y energía están garantizados en los lugares donde se encuentran las personas desplazadas y en las zonas no afectadas por las inundaciones.  En cuanto a seguridad y vigilancia, la Policía brinda seguridad dentro de los albergues y en los alrededores. En las zonas inundadas la vigilancia se realiza por medio de un trabajo coordinado con Policía, Prefectura y Bomberos.  Donaciones  La gestión de las donaciones es realizada por las organizaciones sociales. Respecto a ello subrayamos que, en estos momentos el SINAE, como ámbito de articulación del conjunto del Estado uruguayo dispone de todos los recursos técnicos, materiales, logísticos y humanos así como de los planes y protocolos necesarios para asegurar una respuesta efectiva en la zona afectada.  No obstante, considerando a las personas e instituciones que deseen realizar donaciones, se recuerda la importancia de donar solamente aquello que fue solicitado por el Comité Departamental de Emergencias respectivo, en las condiciones y tiempos requeridos.  En este sentido es preciso aclarar que ningún departamento está aceptando donaciones de ropa o calzado.  En Montevideo, los siguientes centros están recibiendo elementos de higiene personal, ropa de cama, alimentos secos, pañales, repelentes y filtros solares.  Para colaborar con el departamento de ARTIGAS: Centro de Estudiantes de Artigas (Bvar. España 2080 entre Pablo de María y Blanes - 099 369 789).  Para colaborar con el departamento de SALTO: Casa Salto (Juan Manuel Blanes 1053 – 2410 1954). Para colaborar con el departamento de PAYSANDÚ: Asociación Paysandú (Eduardo Acevedo 1120 entre Maldonado y Durazno - 2410 5138).  Operativo retorno  Se continúa monitoreando la situación y se continúa desarrollando la fase de retorno en Artigas. El CECOED realiza las coordinaciones interinstitucionales para que el operativo se desarrolle con eficiencia y eficacia.  Se han conformado equipos de trabajo, integrados por profesionales de diferentes disciplinas. Dichos equipos se ocupan de aspectos edilicios para garantizar la seguridad de las viviendas, realizan las coordinaciones con UTE para restablecer la energía eléctrica y con la Dirección Nacional de Bomberos para las habilitaciones.  Asimismo, equipos de salud evalúan las condiciones sanitarias y equipos operativos llevan a cabo las tareas de desinfección y fumigación de las viviendas, así como la limpieza de cámaras sépticas y pozos negros.  Recomendaciones para el retorno seguro a los hogares luego de la inundación:  Antes de regresar a la vivienda se deben realizar las tareas de limpieza y desinfección. Para hacerlas se recomienda:  Corroborar que todas las personas que colaboren en las tareas de limpieza y desinfección estén vacunadas, en particular contra el tétanos.  Acceder a la vivienda en horas del día con luz natural.  Usar guantes y botas de goma. Nunca acceder descalzo o con sandalias o similar.  Antes de comenzar las tareas de limpieza y desinfección, realizar una atenta observación del entorno, identificar objetos que obstaculicen el paso y evitar tocarlos hasta tener total seguridad de que no haya riesgo eléctrico. Mediante un listón de madera corroborar que esté apagada la llave general de la luz (que debería haber quedado apagada al evacuar la vivienda).  Asegurarse que no haya ningún toma corriente ocupado, es decir ningún artefacto eléctrico conectado. Frente a duda de fugas eléctricas, consultar al Comité Departamental de Emergencias.  Una vez que se tenga total certeza de que no hay riesgo de accidente eléctrico:  Abrir puertas y ventanas para facilitar el secado de las instalaciones.  Usando guantes, botas de goma y tapa bocas, sacar el barro hacia fuera con pala y balde.  Raspar las paredes con una espátula par retirar el lodo seco. Este procedimiento puede levantar polvo, para evitar inhalarlo usar tapa boca.  Lavar el piso y las paredes.  El lavado final debe hacerse con agua que lleve 60 ml de hipoclorito por litro de agua (la concentración comercial de uso del hipoclorito es de 40 gramos por litro). El lavado final implica lavar los pisos y trapear paredes. Este último debe hacerse en sentido circular helicoidal descendente teniendo mucho cuidado para evitar salpicaduras en los ojos.  Lavar todos los envases de alimentos (latas, frascos, recipientes de plástico, etc.) y utensilios (cubiertos, vasos, ollas, etc.) con jabón y agua segura o desinfectada. Sumergirlos durante 30 minutos en una solución de hipoclorito con 5 ml de hipoclorito por litro de agua y luego enjuagarlos con agua segura.  Recordar:  No consumir alimentos que hayan estado en contacto con aguas de la inundación.  En caso de que la inundación haya afectado las cañerías, hervir el agua o agregarle hipoclorito.  Recomendaciones para la desinfección de agua de aspecto u origen sospecho  Hay dos procedimientos de desinfección de agua para consumo humano:  a- Hervirla durante un lapso mínimo de un minuto y un lapso máximo de tres minutos. b- Agregarle hipoclorito de sodio y esperar al menos 30 minutos antes de consumir. En el caso de elegir esta opción, tilizar la cantidad de hipoclorito de acuerdo al detalle que sigue: Solución de hipoclorito  de sodio Para reparaciones menores de 3 litros Para preparaciones de 1000 litros  Hipoclorito de sodio al 4% (uso doméstico) Una gota por litro de agua 50 mililitros cada 1000 litros de agua  Hipoclorito de sodio al 10% (uso industrial) Una gota cada 2,5 litros de agua 20 mililitros cada 1000 litros de agua  Hipoclorito de sodio al 0,5% (uso medicinal) Ocho gotas por cada litro de agua No aplicable  Recordar:  En todos los casos el agua a tratar debe estar límpida y se debe mezclar bien.  Si el agua estuviera turbia se debe dejar decantar y/o filtrar.  Nunca usar soluciones perfumadas o con aditivos.  Recomendaciones a la población  Los recientes eventos meteorológicos, han dejado el lamentable saldo de dos personas fallecidas. Estos casos al igual que otros, están relacionados con incidentes protagonizados por personas que pretendieron transitar caminos, puentes o calzadas que estaban momentáneamente desbordadas por aguas de arroyos o ríos.  El SINAE reitera una vez más el llamado a extremar los cuidados en aquellas zonas que se encuentren momentáneamente inundadas.  Se reitera a la población:  Desplazarse en autos, motos o caballos no disminuye los riesgos de ser arrastrados debido a la cantidad y fuerza de las aguas, sobre todo luego de lluvias intensas y/o prolongadas.  En aquellas zonas de las ciudades que estén inundadas por el desborde de los ríos la precaución debe extremarse, además, por el peligro de posibles áreas electrificadas, incluso dentro de las viviendas afectadas.  Una vez que descienda el nivel de las aguas, el retorno a las viviendas solo podrá hacerse sin riesgo una vez que se proceda a la limpieza y desinfección de las zonas afectadas. El desborde del sistema sanitario y la presencia de alimañas constituyen factores de riesgo extra para la salud de la población. 663\n"

      "The island of Efate, part of the Shefa Province, Vanuatu, saw a record 157.7 mm of rain fall in 24 hours between 06 and 07 October 2014.  The heavy rain has continued to fall for several days and caused widesrpead flash flooding. Over 60 mm was recorded on Tanna island, Tafea Province, in the 24 hours period to 09 October 2014.  Hundreds were evacuated after flash flooding raged in several parts of the country. Vanuatu’s National Disaster Management set up 7 evacuation centres to house the displaced. Disaster authorities say that many of the evacuated have been able to return to their homes, although over 200 remain in the evacuation centre in Eratap Village, south-east of Port Vila, Efate island. Although authorities are still assessing the impact of the flood, Efate island is the area thought to be worst affected, where many homes of the displaced have been severely damaged or completely destroyed.  Local media are reporting that one man died after he was swept away by the swollen La Colle River.  The nearby islands of New Caledonia have also seen heavy rainfall. According to WMO, Ouloup, Ile Ouvea, received 60.4 mm of rain in 24 hours up to 09 October 2014. So far no flooding has been reported. 664\n",

      "People (L) take shelter beside a fallen tree as strong winds batter the coastal area in the Ky Anh district of Vietnam’s central Ha Tinh province on September 30, 2013. Vietnam evacuated tens of thousands of people from high-risk coastal areas on September 30 as a powerful typhoon that left dozens of fishermen missing in the South China Sea slammed into the country. AFP PHOTO  Vietnam evacuated tens of thousands of people from high-risk coastal areas Monday as a powerful typhoon that left dozens of fishermen missing in the East Sea, internationally known as the South China Sea, slammed into the country.  China deployed navy warships and aircraft to search for survivors after three Chinese fishing boats sank in rough waters whipped up by Typhoon Wutip.  More than 70 people were missing, Beijing’s official Xinhua news agency reported, citing maritime authorities.  Vietnam closed schools, ordered all boats ashore and moved some 70,000 people to shelters in vulnerable areas along its central coastline, as high winds and heavy rains uprooted trees and tore the roofs off houses.  Wutip made landfall on Vietnam’s central coast soon after 5:00 pm (10:00 GMT) packing winds of up to 103 kilometres (64 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 133 kph, Vietnam’s National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Center said.  Authorities scrambled to move people from areas at risk of landslides and flash floods, as soldiers joined efforts to build walls of sandbags around coastal villages.  “We have evacuated thousands of people, prepared vehicles, mobilised 5,000 police and soldiers,” Nguyen Duc Cuong, a local communist party official in Quang Tri province, told state-run VTV.  Torrential rain and strong winds battered neighboring Quang Nam Province, with the popular tourist town of Hoi An also affected by heavy flooding.  “This is a big typhoon with strong wind and heavy rain and we urge people to stay overnight in shelters,” Nguyen Van Bong, an official in nearby Ky Anh district, told state television.  Local authorities will be “on duty around the clock” to ensure the area’s reservoirs and vast hydro-electric dams are not damaged or made unsafe by the typhoon, he added.  People in central Vietnam told AFP that there were already sporadic power cuts in several districts.  Vietnam is hit by an average of eight to 10 tropical storms every year, often causing heavy material and human losses, as well as frequent flooding.  In recent weeks floods have killed at least 24 people in Vietnam and claimed 30 lives in Cambodia, as well as 22 in Thailand.  Cambodian police said four people — believed to be Syrians, including two children — died late Sunday when their car was swept away in floodwaters.  In China, President Xi Jinping called for an “all-out rescue effort” urging local authorities to “do their utmost to find the missing or stranded and minimise casualties” caused by the typhoon, Xinhua said.  Rescue efforts had been hampered by strong gales and high waves, it said.  The Chinese boats, which were together carrying 88 fishermen, sank after they attempted to navigate gales near the disputed Paracel Islands, about 330 kilometres (200 miles) from China’s southern coast.  China’s maritime authority on Sunday raised its alert on the typhoon to orange, its second-highest of four levels, Xinhua reported.  Storm tides might strike the provinces of Guangdong, Hainan and Guangxi, it added, citing the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Centre.  The Paracel islands are claimed by China, Vietnam and Taiwan, but Chinese fishermen often travel there in search of bigger hauls.  Last week, Typhoon Usagi left at least 25 people dead after crashing ashore in southern China, throwing transport systems into chaos and leaving tens of thousands of airline passengers stranded in Hong Kong.  China’s civil affairs ministry said 226,000 people were relocated due to that storm and more than 7,100 houses collapsed or were badly damaged.

      "On Wednesday morning, the Phu Kieng wooden bridge in Nha Trang City's Vinh Ngoc Commune is swept away as the water level in Cai River rises.— Photo vov.vn  HA NOI — Heavy rain in the past four days in central Viet Nam triggered floods that claimed eight lives, submerged nearly 1,000 houses, and forced thousands to evacuate, authorities said yesterday.  It continued to rain heavily on Wednesday, causing serious flooding in many areas, and threatened the lives of many residents including students in Khanh Hoa Province.  Three seventh-grade students of Tran Nhan Tong Secondary School in Khanh Hoa's Dien Khanh District drowned after falling into a pit at a construction site on Monday, police said.  The students fell into a 30m-long and 2m-deep pit when they stopped to play by the roadside after school, the police said.  The pit, which had been dug by a road construction firm, was filled with water because it had rained earlier. However, the construction agency had not placed any warning signs for residents.  The fourth student, 11-year-old Nguyen Thi Xuan Quyen, died while she was riding her bicycle to school on Monday morning. Due to the heavy rain, the road was inundated and resulted in Quyen falling into the canal and being washed away.  Quyen's body was found the next day.  Tran Minh Nghi, 42, resides in Nha Trang City reportedly died after she fell into a river on Monday, and Phung Vo, 76, from Ninh Hoa Town was reported missing while going fishing on Tuesday.  The Committee for Disaster Prevention and Search and Rescue in Khanh Hoa province, said the rain had flooded 1,000 houses and affected a lot of shrimp breeding ponds.  On Wednesday morning, the Phu Kieng wooden bridge in Nha Trang City's Vinh Ngoc Commune was swept away as the water level in Cai River rose.  The Phu Kieng wooden bridge over the Cai River, links three villages on the other side of the river with the centre of Vinh Ngoc Commune.  Le Van My, chairman of Vinh Ngoc Commune's People's Committee said the destruction of the bridge could cause problems for residents living on both sides of the river.  He also said residents were hoping that a new bridge would be constructed as soon as possible to reduce traffic accidents.  Heavy rain combined with high tides caused severe landslides at the fishing port of Tuy Hoa City's Ward 6 in Phu Yen Province.  Local authorities have evacuated residents in the coastal areas to safety, while using rocks and sandbags to protect coastal erosion. Meanwhile, tidal waves caused severe erosion in Cua Lo area, of Binh Trung village, Tam Hai commune in Quang Nam province's Nui Thanh district, threatening the lives of dozens of households.  Tran Ngoc Huu, chairman of Tam Hai commune, said that up to 12m of land was lost every year due to storms.  According to the disaster prevention department for Central and Central Highlands, heavy rain was expected in the provinces from Quang Binh to Ninh Thuan, which would continue for several days.  The rains could bring floods in the central provinces of Quang Tri to Khanh Hoa. The provinces also face the risk of flash floods and landslides in the mountainous areas. – VNS 677\n",

      "Government, through the Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU), has distributed tents to the 662 families whose houses collapsed after heavy rains in Mumbwa district in Central province.  Deputy Minister in the Office of the Vice President Harry Kalaba handed over the tents and assured the affected families of government’s commitment to mitigating their situation.  Mr. Kalaba said only 85 tents have been distributed to the families today adding that more are yet to be delivered to the victims.  He also distributed mosquito nets and chlorine to the victims.  He said plans were underway for portable toilets to be delivered at the four schools in the district which were closed after their toilets collapsed due to the heavy rains.  Mr. Kalaba said government was concerned that crops were dying due to floods in the district.  He said to this effect, government was engaged in consultations to find a lasting solution to the problem.  He expressed sorrow that a life was lost in the tragic collapse of the houses saying government will do its best to prevent more loss of lives.  Last week, 662 houses collapsed due to heavy rains in Mumbwa district, leaving hundreds of people homeless. 681\n",
      "GOVERNMENT has stepped up efforts in getting relief food to more than 1,000 people displaced by floods in Kaputa.  The Food Reserve Agency (FRA) has released 12 tonnes of maize, while a boat has also been deployed to the area after a bridge on Mporokoso-Kaputa Road collapsed.  Northern Province Minister Freedom Sikazwe said a Zambian National Service land development unit based in Mansa in Luapula Province has also been dispatched to assess and put up a temporary  crossing.  “As far as food is concerned the disaster management unit has begun distributing the relief food, a fact that was confirmed to me by the District Commissioner in Kaputa,” Mr Sikazwe said.  While 30 tents had been put up to provide shelter to the 1,063 residents who were left homeless after their houses flooded and others collapsed following unrelenting rains in the area, Mr Sikazwe said an additional 100 tents were needed.  Mr Sikazwe, who was in Kaputa to assess the situation, directed the Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit to begin the distribution of food and other materials to some of the families accommodated at a school.  The minister described the situation in Kaputa as dire, adding that what he feared the most was a possible outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases because lavatories were submerged and faecal matter had contaminated water sources.  A medical team had been dispatched but was making slow progress because of the bad condition of the road.  Mr Sikazwe assured the affected families that Government would provide all the necessities required to see them through the disaster.  He asked the provincial medical office to consider dispatching some mobile hospitals to Kaputa because they were four-wheel drive and could easily traverse the area.  Meanwhile, heavy rain have destroyed more than 450 crops fields in Nsama District.  The rain which resulted in flooding in Kaputa extended to Nsama where fields were flooded.  Nsama District Commissioner Panji Chilingala said yesterday that it was estimated that close to 600 fields of the staple maize and cassava could be affected.  Mr Chilangala, who described the situation as serious, said the compromised food security had pushed up mealie-meal prices to K150 per K25 bag.  He said the residents had appealed to Government to sell subsided maize to them through the FRA.  Times of Zambia 682\n"

      "A report from Human Rights Watch claims that the Zimbabwe government has used violence, harassment, and the deliberate restriction of humanitarian aid to coerce an estimated 20,000 flood victims to resettle on tiny land plots where the government plans to establish a sugar cane plantation.  The 20,000 flood victims were forced from their homes after the flooding in the Tokwe-Mukorsi dam basin in February 2014.  The Human Rights Watch report, “Homeless, Landless, and Destitute: The Plight of Zimbabwe’s Tokwe-Mukorsi Flood Victims,” documents human rights violations suffered by those displaced by the floods.  In the immediate aftermath of the flood, the Zimbabwean army relocated the 20,000 victims – or 3,300 families – to Chingwizi Camp on Nuanetsi Ranch, where they received assistance from the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies. Conditions in the camps were known to be poor, as this report explains.  The government then told the flood victims that they should move to their new plots earmarked for sugar cane growing at Bongo and Nyoni, 20 kilometers away.  When the flood victims refused, government authorities began to deny them food assistance, limited their access to water and toilets, and barred or diverted aid donations intended for their assistance. In April 2014, the local government minister, Ignatious Chombo, said publicly that “food assistance will only be given to those families who agree to move to their permanent plots.” Within six months after the camp opened, the government closed it, along with its health clinic and school.  The victims were given no choice but to accept one-hectare plots of land on a farm earmarked for growing sugar cane that has close links to the ZANU-PF ruling party of President Robert Mugabe.  “The Zimbabwean government has stopped at nothing to coerce 20,000 flood victims to accept a resettlement package that provides labor for a government project, but leaves the flood victims utterly destitute,” said Dewa Mavhinga, southern Africa senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Zimbabwean government should immediately give the victims adequate aid without conditions and compensate them fairly for their losses.”  Floods Were Man Made  The ill-fated relocation began in February 2014, when heavy rains flooded the dam’s basin. The authorities maintain the floods were a natural disaster resulting from climate change, which resulted in record rainfalls. Dam project workers and an engineer familiar with the dam construction told Human Rights Watch, however, that the floods could have been prevented by letting out water downstream.  At the time of the flooding, our FloodList report “Threat of Imminent Kariba Dam Wall Collapse Denied” that there had been question marks over the imminent failure of the dam.  Satellite images of the floods taken between December 2013 and May 2014, and analyzed by Human Rights Watch, strongly suggest that there was no effort to reduce water levels or to minimize the flooding until weeks after the flooding began.  Despite residents’ pleas to allow water to flow downstream, armed soldiers evicted the residents from their land, including some far from the flood areas. One flood victim said that the soldiers told residents:  President Mugabe directed that this dam should be constructed so that it contains water in it, and you ask us to let the water out? No. It is time for you to leave now. You will receive your compensation later, when [the] government gets the money.  “The circumstances leading to the floods are suspicious and flood victims have a right to know if it could have been avoided, as many lost property in the emergency relocation,” Mavhinga said. “The Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission should immediately investigate the circumstances leading to the floods and, if necessary, ensure that those responsible are held to account.”  Violence and Intimidation  Some of the flood victims were already slated for resettlement prior to the emergency, but had resisted moving without receiving fair compensation for their property. The government used violence and intimidation to quell protests, and restricted food distribution and health and education services to those who refused to accept government resettlement plans.  When flood victims protested, and violence broke out, anti-riot police indiscriminately beat and arrested about 300 people, mostly men, witnesses told Human Rights Watch.  Most of those arrested were later released, except one woman and three men, including Mike Mudyanembwa, the chair of the victims’ Chingwizi Camp Committee, who had not been at the demonstration. These four were charged with public violence and sentenced to five years in prison on January 27, 2015; their lawyers said they had been tortured in prison.  In the wake of the protests, many men fled the camp, fearing arrest. The police forced the women, the sick, and the disabled who remained to sit in the sun without access to toilets for two days as punishment, then moved them to the one-hectare plots.  1 Hectare Plots Inadequate  The flood victims oppose the government’s plans. They told Human Rights Watch that the plots are too small to support their families with basic kitchen gardens, that they had been promised five hectares, and that they are being given no choice but to grow sugar cane, which they have no experience cultivating. Many have received no compensation for the loss of their land.  The flood victims have been left destitute at the new plots. They said the last food aid distribution from the World Food Program (WFP) was in September 2014 and that they have to walk up to 20 kilometers for clean drinking water, since the boreholes the government constructed were dry or produced saltwater.  Sugar Cane and Ethanol Project  Under the government’s plans, the flood victims are required to grow sugar cane on Nuanetsi Ranch in the Mwenezi district of Masvingo province to contribute to a government-owned ethanol project. They would not be permitted to grow other crops. They said the arrangement would leave them with no livelihood until the scheme was fully operational, expected to be in about seven years.  The provincial affairs minister for Masvingo province, Kudakwashe Bhasikiti, told Human Rights Watch in an August 2014 interview that the flood victims would eventually benefit from the ethanol project and that families growing sugar cane would help the project achieve profitability more quickly than if they were permitted to grow crops of their choosing. In other interviews, Bhasikiti branded those who opposed the government’s plans as “rebels” and “enemies of the state.” 687\n",
