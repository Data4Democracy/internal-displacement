       "\"Flash flooding across Afghanistan and Pakistan has left more than 160 dead and dozens stranded in one of South Asia's worst natural disasters this year, say officials.  The flooding, caused by unusually heavy rain, has left villagers stuck in remote areas without shelter, food or power.  Mountainous Afghanistan was the worst hit, with 61 people killed and approximately 500 traditional mud-brick homes washed away in more than a dozen villages in Sarobi, a rural district less than an hour from Kabul, officials said.  Floods left a village devastated in the remote eastern Afghan province of Nuristan. At least 60 homes were destroyed across three districts, said provincial spokesman Mohammad Yusufi. No one was killed.  Authorities have been unable to deliver aid to some badly affected villages by land as roads in the area are controlled by the Taliban, Yusufi added.  “We have asked the national government for help as have an overwhelming number of locals asking for assistance, but this is a Taliban-ridden area,” Yusufi said.  At least 24 people were also died in two other eastern border provinces, Khost and Nangarhar, according to local officials. More than fifty homes and shops were destroyed and thousands of acres of farmland flooded.  In Pakistan monsoon rains claimed more than 80 lives, local media reported. Houses collapsing, drowning and electrocution all pushed up the death toll, said Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon.  In Karachi, the commercial capital and a southern port city that is home to 18 million people, poor neighborhoods were submerged waist-deep in water and many precincts suffered long power outages. Deaths were also reported in the north and west of the country.  Additional reporting by Reuters\""

The districts of Garyzan, Pashtunkot and Belcheragh were worst affected. BNA report that at least 7 people were killed and over 1,500 homes damaged. The Faizabada-Takhar highway have been closed to traffic and wide areas of crops and orchards have suffered damaged.  Kuwaiti News Agency (KUNA) also report that flooding struck in the Baghlan-i-Markazi district of Baghlan province, where 1 person was killed and several injured early on Saturday 09 May 2015.  “There was heavy rain in Baghlan-e-Markazi district Friday evening and the people left their houses to safer areas. It was early Saturday when a flash flood hit the area and washed away more than 500 houses,” district Governor Gohar Khan Babri told reporters in provincial capital Pul-e-Khumri, 160 km north of Kabul.'"

       "\"Flash flooding across Afghanistan and Pakistan has left more than 160 dead and dozens stranded in one of South Asia's worst natural disasters this year, say officials.  The flooding, caused by unusually heavy rain, has left villagers stuck in remote areas without shelter, food or power.  Mountainous Afghanistan was the worst hit, with 61 people killed and approximately 500 traditional mud-brick homes washed away in more than a dozen villages in Sarobi, a rural district less than an hour from Kabul, officials said.  Floods left a village devastated in the remote eastern Afghan province of Nuristan. At least 60 homes were destroyed across three districts, said provincial spokesman Mohammad Yusufi. No one was killed.  Authorities have been unable to deliver aid to some badly affected villages by land as roads in the area are controlled by the Taliban, Yusufi added.  “We have asked the national government for help as have an overwhelming number of locals asking for assistance, but this is a Taliban-ridden area,” Yusufi said.  At least 24 people were also died in two other eastern border provinces, Khost and Nangarhar, according to local officials. More than fifty homes and shops were destroyed and thousands of acres of farmland flooded.  In Pakistan monsoon rains claimed more than 80 lives, local media reported. Houses collapsing, drowning and electrocution all pushed up the death toll, said Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon.  In Karachi, the commercial capital and a southern port city that is home to 18 million people, poor neighborhoods were submerged waist-deep in water and many precincts suffered long power outages. Deaths were also reported in the north and west of the country.  Additional reporting by Reuters\""

He added that heavy rains had destroyed as many as 400 residences.  “Hundreds of families have had to leave their homes after they were inundated with water,” Sudani told The Anadolu Agency.  www.aa.com.tr/en  Last month neighbouring Tunisia experienced heavy rainfall and flooding in Jendouba City.'"

      "Flash flooding across Afghanistan and Pakistan has left more than 160 dead and dozens stranded in one of South Asia's worst natural disasters this year, say officials.  The flooding, caused by unusually heavy rain, has left villagers stuck in remote areas without shelter, food or power.  Mountainous Afghanistan was the worst hit, with 61 people killed and approximately 500 traditional mud-brick homes washed away in more than a dozen villages in Sarobi, a rural district less than an hour from Kabul, officials said.  Floods left a village devastated in the remote eastern Afghan province of Nuristan. At least 60 homes were destroyed across three districts, said provincial spokesman Mohammad Yusufi. No one was killed.  Authorities have been unable to deliver aid to some badly affected villages by land as roads in the area are controlled by the Taliban, Yusufi added.  “We have asked the national government for help as have an overwhelming number of locals asking for assistance, but this is a Taliban-ridden area,” Yusufi said.  At least 24 people were also died in two other eastern border provinces, Khost and Nangarhar, according to local officials. More than fifty homes and shops were destroyed and thousands of acres of farmland flooded.  In Pakistan monsoon rains claimed more than 80 lives, local media reported. Houses collapsing, drowning and electrocution all pushed up the death toll, said Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon.  In Karachi, the commercial capital and a southern port city that is home to 18 million people, poor neighborhoods were submerged waist-deep in water and many precincts suffered long power outages. Deaths were also reported in the north and west of the country.  Additional reporting by Reuters\n",

      "15 families evacuated Sunday, October 18, 2015 Earthquake in Salta kills a 94-year-old woman, injures 30  The debris of collapsed houses is pictured in El Galpón, Salta province, yesterday. A magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck northwest Argentina, the US Geological Survey reported, leaving at least one person dead and damaging homes. Salta Governor Juan Manuel Urtubey visited the town and promised repair works.  A magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck Salta province yesterday, killing one woman, injuring at least 30 people and extensively damaging the town of El Galpón.  The earthquake hit the town of El Galpón, which is roughly 170 kilometres by road from the provincial capital and 50 kilometres from the epicentre of the earthquake, at 8:33 in the morning yesterday, causing roofs to collapse. Ninety-four-year-old Alberta Flores was killed by a falling beam while she slept. Local doctors reported that 30 others were treated for minor cut and scrapes.  Salta Governor Juan Manuel Urtubey rushed to the town, promising to help reconstruct damaged homes and buildings and confirming that 15 families have been evacuated to the town hall as a precaution against collapse. Urtubey and his Cabinet made the trip to a town where 7,000 residents live after Mayor Héctor Romero appealed for assistance on local radio.  “We don’t have water, the power is out, what we are living through is terrible,” said Romero to the Cadena 3 radio station.  “I was at home and I felt a strong movement and noise, I got my kids out of the house — which also suffered damage to the roof — I went outside and saw that the school had been destroyed. Thank God this was on a Saturday because if not, it would have taken all of the kids.”  Urtubey has ordered that a damage assessment be carried out so that works can start tomorrow. He also said that even though the situation was under control, the province’s medical helicopter was available for the residents of El Galpón if necessary.  In addition to the multiple brick buildings that came down as a result of the tremor, there were reports of damage to the local hospital. Images and video from the town featured bricks scattered across the pavement and shattered walls teetering perilously.  The 5.9 quake lasted for approximately 15 seconds and was reported to have taken place 10 kilometres underground and was felt in neighbouring provinces such as Jujuy, Tucumán, Catamarca, Santiago del Estero and even parts of Chaco province according to the DyN news agency.  Northern Argentina commonly experiences low-intensity earthquakes but yesterday’s was the third this calendar year in Salta with an intensity of at least 5 on the Richter scale.  Argentina’s most destructive earthquake dates back to 1944, killing 10,000 people in the province of San Juan and wiped out large sections of the provincial capital.\n",

      "PRAGUE—Thousands were forced from their homes and at least 10 people were killed as floodwaters deluged swathes of Europe on Monday, including the historic center of the Czech capital Prague.  Shops and schools were shut and road and rail transports were disrupted across the Czech Republic, Austria and Germany following torrential rains.  The flooding caused chaos at Prague Zoo where around 1,000 animals were moved to higher ground after the Vltava river burst its banks late Sunday.  ADVERTISEMENT  Zookeepers had to tranquilize tigers and other large animals in a dramatic overnight operation.  “It’s a terrifying feeling to experience this all over again,” Petr Velensky, the zoo’s reptile specialist, told AFP, recalling how many animals drowned in a 2002 flood.  Czech rescue crews were searching for four more people believed to have died in floodwaters that cut power to tens of thousands of households.  The heavy rainfall has triggered nightmarish memories of the 2002 floods that killed dozens in the region including 17 in the Czech Republic alone.  The Czech government declared a state of emergency Sunday, deploying 2,000 troops in its rescue drive as more than 8,000 people were evacuated from their homes, officials said.  A house collapse claimed two lives south of Prague, while an electrician was killed trying to switch off a transformer as a precaution, a woman perished when she was hit by a falling tree branch and three men drowned in rivers or drains around the country, police said.  “You realize here what nature can do. How helpless we really are despite having all our technology,” Prague pensioner Helena Holubova said, watching the water rise from a bridge over the Vltava in central Prague.  With Prague’s 14th-century Charles Bridge under threat, a 25-ton excavator was at work throughout the day Monday to remove debris piling up around the structure.  Nikol Voborilova, a worker at a riverside restaurant in Prague, told AFP: “We are closed for now, we’ve moved the equipment out and we have 30-40 centimeters (12 to 16 inches) of water inside.”  The river was expected to peak in the capital on Tuesday.  Thousands of households were hit with power outages, while fallen trees snarled rail traffic across western regions of the Czech Republic, where chemical plants were also shut down as a precaution to prevent dangerous spills seen in 2002.  Flooding also deluged neighboring Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Two people were reported dead in Austria and another person died in Switzerland.  “We’re in shock. We had to leave home in the blink of an eye,” a woman in the eastern German city of Dresden which had been severely damaged in 2002 told the NTV channel.  She and her baby spent the night at a community center, like thousands of others evacuated in the eastern region of Saxony, where rescue efforts by police and soldiers were being hampered by power outages.  Some 2,500 people were evacuated from hard-hit Grimma, near Leipzig.  Two people were reported missing in Germany.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel was due to visit flood-hit regions Tuesday.  In Austria, two people were killed in flooding and close to 1,000 were evacuated as landslides threatened their homes, mostly around the western city of Salzburg and in the north.  Authorities in Austria warned that the Danube and the Inn rivers could surpass levels from 2002, when the country suffered up to 7.5 billion euros ($9.8 billion) in damage.  Water levels on the Danube, Inn and Ilz rivers, which meet in the German city of Passau, have already surpassed records from 2002 and 1954.  “A lot of people who already had to cope with major flooding in 2002 are refusing to leave their homes,” Passau mayor Juergen Duppen told Germany’s N24 TV channel.—Jan Flemr\n",

Mud and debris from the landslip inundated a section of the Great Alpine Road, forcing the closure of one lane.  The woman escaped serious injury, a police spokeswoman said.  At Moyhu, near Wangaratta, a burst of heavy rain caused flash flooding and brought down trees.  Advertisement  The State Emergency Service received more than 100 calls for help as more than 50 millimetres of rain fell in the area in an hour.  The storms brought down more than 70 trees in the area, damaging 14 buildings, an SES spokeswoman said. Four homes were flooded.  The heaviest rainfall was recorded at Carboor​ Upper, where 94.6 millimetres fell in two hours.  The small town of Eurobin received 82.6 millimetres, while Mount Buffalo received 64 millimetres.  Closer to Melbourne, Traralgon received 36 millimetres.  It was fortunate the storms developed just east of Melbourne, Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Scott Williams said.  \"It would have been mayhem on our roads if that rain had fallen here,\" he said.  Mr Williams said Wednesday and Thursday would be fine and sunny, ahead of a cooler spell on Friday and Saturday.  A top of 21 degrees is forecast for Friday, while a maximum of 19 is forecast for Saturday, with possible showers in Melbourne and southern Victoria.\n",

      "The number of homes destroyed in the Wye River fire on Victoria’s Great Ocean Road on Christmas Day has risen to 116.  Country Fire Authority deputy incident controller Mark Gunning said 116 houses in Wye River and Separation Creek had been destroyed in the 2200-hectare blaze.  “That will probably be the final number, as we’ve just completed an extensive search,” Gunning said on Saturday evening.  The fire swept through bushland and began to advance toward the town of Lorne on Friday night.    And the emergency management commissioner, Craig Lapsley, said the blaze could continue burning until January or February. Even a dousing of rain on Saturday was unlikely to do much in the long term once the state began to dry out. “This fire doesn’t go away,” Lapsley said.  Great Ocean Road bushfire: homes destroyed as five towns evacuated Read more  More than 300 firefighters spent the night fighting the fire after the town of Lorne was evacuated on Friday evening. Residents were told they could go home after an evacuation recommendation was lifted shortly after 9am on Saturday.  The nearby townships of Wye River, Separation Creek, Kennett River and Grey River were evacuated earlier on Friday afternoon. Emergency warnings remain in place for Wye River and Separation Creek, and both areas remained closed on Saturday afternoon.  “Power is out, though fallen domestic solar power lines remain a threat,” a Country Fire Authority notice said.    “There are a number of hazardous tress that have been burnt and are dangerous, and damage to septic systems can result in leaking sewerage and health hazards.”    Crews were also assessing the full extent of property damage in area.    Watch and act alerts were in place for Lorne, Allenvale, Kennett River and Grey River on Saturday.      Lapsley said on Saturday morning: “Obviously we are very pleased to see the emergency warning lifted for Lorne, and that means VicRoads and VicPol can now go about restoring roads so people can access all the way down the coast to Lorne.    “However, the roads from Lorne south will be closed for days until VicRoads and others, local government, do their assessments of the roads to ensure they are safe and until they are safe people won’t be able to access that area.  “Those people in Wye River and Separation Creek that have lost properties, we’ll do our best in the next 24 hours to get those people back in to have a look at the damage, the impact and destruction that this fire has caused.”  Lapsley said strong local winds on Friday had blown embers over control lines – something that had only been expected to happen on a much hotter, windier day – but the response was well planned.  “That plan played out. It was actioned just before lunchtime on Christmas Day where the community were told to evacuate. And they did that in a very orderly way.  “We always say that primacy of life is the critical issue in the state particularly after the royal commission [into the] fires of 2009. That’s the direct result of why we haven’t lost life for what is a very intense fire yesterday … [people] walked away from the fire that had every potential to be a killer.”  Daniel Andrews, the state premier, said Victorians were “opening up their homes” and assisting people who had “not had a very good Christmas at all – people who are out of their homes, out of their areas and doing it tough at the moment. The very best comes out at the very worst of times.    “This is really a very challenging fire – but in the planning and the execution and indeed in terms of the outcomes, no person has been harmed. That’s something that we can be very proud of.  “It will be a very difficult few days, though, indeed many weeks, for those who have lost their homes, or at least have lost a premises. I can confirm that 35 houses are gone in Wye River, 18 are gone in Separation Creek. And the fire stopped just some 500 metres short of Kennett River. There would have been several more losses if it had kept going.”  Weather over the next few days has been predicted to be favourable for firefighting, with rain and lower temperatures.  The main firefront had not gone through Kennett River, but firefighters defending homes there had put out spot fires and no properties had been reported burnt.  Holidaymakers were being advised on Saturday to stay away, and those away from their homes were told not to return yet.  The Great Ocean Road remained closed from Bellbrae to Skenes Creek on Saturday morning but was reopened between Torquay and Lorne.  Community meetings were due to be held at lunchtime on Saturday at relief centres in Apollo Bay and Torquay.  Organisers of the Falls music festival, due to be held near Lorne from Monday, were due to meet fire authorities at noon on Saturday to discuss whether it could go ahead.    “The township of Lorne is now being evacuated, the Falls farm itself is safe from the path of the fires,” a statement on festival’s website said.    “We are working with the CFA, fire authorities and emergency services to stay across the current situation.”    The festival is scheduled to begin on Monday and run until New Year’s Day.  The Bureau of Meteorology predicted a top of 18C at Lorne on Boxing Day and up to 20mm of rain.  \n",

Around 33,000 households in the area are now without power, she said, warning that this number was likely to grow as the day progresses.  \"It is still a dangerous cyclone.

      "El número de personas fallecidas por el deslizamiento de un cerro en el departamento boliviano de Cochabamba (centro) a causa de las lluvias se elevó a 14, entre ellos varios niños, informaron hoy fuentes oficiales.    El alcalde de Morochata, Juan Vegamonte, señaló que las víctimas son ya 14, aunque hasta ahora sólo se han recuperado cuatro cuerpos, uno de ellos el de un pequeño de cuatro años, según un reporte de radio Erbol.    La avalancha se produjo el pasado sábado por la noche en el municipio de Morochata a consecuencia de las intensas lluvias de las últimas semanas, y sepultó numerosas viviendas a las que los equipos de rescate tratan de acceder con gran dificultad, por lo que aún no se han recuperado los cuerpos de al menos diez personas.    Entre los sepultados hay otros seis niños, según la secretaria de los Derechos de la Madre Tierra en Cochabamba, Cinthia Vargas.    Tareas de rescate van lentas  Las tareas de rescate también se han visto ralentizadas debido a que el terreno aún es inestable y podrían ocurrir nuevos deslizamientos.    Más de diez familias han sido evacuadas por seguridad a otra comunidad de Morochata.    El presidente de Bolivia, Evo Morales, se desplazó esta madrugada a la zona afectada para coordinar las labores de ayuda a los damnificados, anunció por su parte el vicepresidente Álvaro García Linera.    Morales ha sobrevolado las áreas afectadas y aterrizará en Cochabamba si el tiempo lo permite, indicó García Linera a través de un comunicado de la Vicepresidencia.    La temporada de lluvias, que en Bolivia se extiende desde octubre a marzo, ha dejado ya 40 fallecidos, cuatro desaparecidos y casi 47,000 familias afectadas, además de pérdidas millonarias en los sectores agrícola y ganadero.    A esas cifras se suman ahora las 14 víctimas mortales por el derrumbe del cerro en Morochata.    El departamento más afectado por las intensas precipitaciones es el de Cochabamba, seguido por los de Chuquisaca, Potosí, La Paz, Beni, Santa Cruz y Pando.\n",

At least 41 people have died and nearly 70,000 have been left homeless following torrential rain in southeast Brazil over the past few weeks, officials have said.  In Espirito Santo state, Civil Defence officials on Thursday reported a total of 27 fatalities, including eight on Thursday, in what they described as the worst rains in 90 years.  They said 61,379 people were forced to leave their homes.  President Dilma Rousseff interrupted her year-end holidays on Friday to tour flood-hit areas of Espirito Santo.  \"We are going to have to rebuild the state,\" said Governor Renato Casagrande amid extensive flooding and damage to bridges and roads.  In neighbouring Minas Gerais state, where the downpours began in October and have worsened in the past few days, have authorities reported 17 deaths and said 4,150 people were forced to evacuate their homes.  A 56-year-old woman died on Wednesday in a landslide that buried her house in Juiz de Fora, 278 kilometres from Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais.  Aid pledge  Last week, a family of six, including a seven-year-old child, died when a mudslide swept away their home in Sardoa, in the eastern part of the state.  A total of 79 towns were affected across Minas Gerais and a state of alert was declared in 26 of them.

      "TORONTO – The City of Calgary says only a small number of buildings may still be without power in the downtown core after last week’s devastating floods in southern Alberta that left three dead.  Officials say some structures may not yet have power because of specific electrical or other issues that need to be resolved first and officials say work will continue to restore electrical service to a number of residential neighbourhoods that were also hard hit by flooding.  In Medicine Hat, inspectors will carry on checking homes Wednesday as thousands of homeowners were forced out as a precaution when levels rose dramatically on the South Saskatchewan River.  Owners are being urged to clean their properties if they encounter problems to avoid health concerns.  In dozens of neighbourhoods in flood-ravaged Alberta communities, thousands of volunteers are helping residents struggling to clean up and around their homes. On Monday, approximate 2,500 people showed up at McMahon Stadium in Calgary alone, ready to help strangers.  Earlier this week, Alberta Environment officials said it has completed or is working to implement 13 of the 18 recommendations contained in the flood mitigation report that was presented to the government in 2006.  The work has included mapping the flood risk of 90 rivers and streams.  As residents continue to clean up after the flood, here’s a brief “by the numbers” look at the Alberta floods (please note: numbers below are subject to constant change):  100,000 to 120,000 – The number of people that were forced out of their homes across Alberta due to the floods.  75,000 – Estimated number of Calgarians that were evacuated last week. 10,000 are still waiting to return home.  2,000 – Number of Calgary evacuees still housed in emergency centres or dormitories.  75,000 – Number of citizens who had to flee high water from the Bow and Elbow rivers after last week’s floods.  22- Number of confirmed local states of emergency as of June 25.  10 – The number of years it could take to rebuild the communities in flood affected areas in Alberta.  22 – Number of active local Emergency Operations Centres in southern Alberta.  13,000 to 15,000 – Number of residents evacuated from High River in Alberta.  80 – Percentage of High River that remained without services and the waste-water treatment plant wasn’t working as of Monday.  11,000 – Number of homes and businesses still out of power in Calgary.  9 – Number of community support centres being opened around flood zones Wednesday.  300 – Approximate number of people who ignored the High River evacuation order.  5 – Number of Alberta Search and Rescue teams working with emergency responders in affected communities.  31 – Number of communities directly affected by the floods. Find out the latest info here.  1,000 – Approximate number of homes that were hit by high water in Medicine Hat. Nearly 10,000 residents in that city were forced to head for higher ground.  1,200 – Approximate number of Siksika First Nation residents that were evacuated due to heavy flooding along the Bow River.  1,500 – Number of people registered at Medicine Hat’s emergency centre as of Sunday June 24. Accommodation had been provided for about 600 displaced residents.  $1,000,000,000 – The amount of money the province of Alberta has approved to kick-start flood recovery.  $3 to $5 billion – Initial flood damage estimates according to preliminary report from BMO analyst Tom MacKinnon. BMO predicts 25 per cent will not be covered by insurance.  $1,250 – The amount of money given to displaced adults who qualify for a pre-loaded debit card in order to help with their immediate housing needs and day-to-day purchases. $500 will be given per eligible child.  $400 million – The damage cost of the last major flood to hit Calgary in 2005.\n",

      "Wildfires have forced evacuations in two Alberta communities and in the B.C. interior.  Emergency alerts have been issued for Nordegg and Lodgepole in Alberta because two separate fires are burning within a few kilometres of each community, and a rapidly growing fire in central B.C. has forced the evacuations of about 50 homes.  Between 40 and 250 people were affected by the wildfires in Nordegg, Alta., an official said. (Courtesy Clearwater County Twitter, @clearwtrcnty)  The fire near Nordegg, 200 kilometres southwest of Edmonton, has been burning for several days with residents on a one-hour evacuation notice since Thursday.  The fire grew overnight reaching more than 300 hectares.  Duncan MacDonnell with Alberta Sustainable Resource Development said crews had the fire contained, but officials were still poised to issue an evacuation order if the blaze broke through any containment points.  MacDonnell said the fire near Lodgepole, which is about 100 kilometres southwest of Edmonton, is new.  Wildfire information officers with the province said late Sunday that as the sun set and winds died down, the situation with both fires appeared to be calming down and their spread was slowing.  About 100 Nordegg residents were forced from their homes.  About 140 people from Lodgepole registered at the evacuation centre in Drayton Valley. Displaced residents said they couldn't believe how quickly the situation escalated.  \"Next thing I hear was the siren,\" said Gail Tkaczyk. \"And it's the police officer coming down the driveway and we've got to go. No time to think twice.\"  \"You don't have enough time to really think properly,\" said Evangeline Braun. \"Grabbed my dog and it was get on the road. That was that quick. So there wasn't much time at all.\"  Braun said the volunteers at the evacuation centre have been kind and helpful. \"I want to say thank you to all of them,\" she said.  1,260 hectares burn near Lodgepole  Roughly 1,260 hectares were burning in the fire near Lodgepole by early Monday evening as winds had pushed the blaze towards the community.  About 120 firefighters were on the ground, with more expected on Tuesday.  The fire was considered \"laying low\" as of Monday at noon, but firefighters remained concerned the winds could pick up in the afternoon.  Residents living a few miles east of Lodgepole near Highway 620 and Range Road 90 are taking in stride a one-hour evacuation alert.  \"Nothing we haven't seen before,\" said Ken Newby as he continued doing chores around the yard, noting there was less smoke than yesterday.  George Cook said he \"didn't think it was anything to be concerned about,\" leaving for work as usual in Drayton Valley Monday morning.  Alberta issued a fire weather advisory for the province Sunday, saying that high winds and dry temperatures made the likelihood of uncontrolled wildfires high.  Residents of Nordegg are being told to go to Rocky Mountain House about 100 kilometres east of the community.  Lodgepole residents are being told to go to Drayton Valley, which is about 50 kilometres away.  Last week, a provincial official said conditions in some areas were similar to May 2011 when flames roared through the town of Slave Lake, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing thousands of people to flee. The wildfire caused an estimated $1 billion in damage, including firefighting and relief costs.  In B.C., the 1,100-hectare Spatsum Creek fire, west of Kamloops and about 20 kilometres south of Ashton, has more than doubled in size since Saturday as winds have fanned the flames.  Kevin Skrepnek, spokesman for the B.C. Wildfire Management Branch, says hot weather has caused an increase in the number of wildfires this year. There have already been 177 wildfires in the province since April 1 — all but two have been caused by human error.\n",

      "By KHRISNA VIRGIL  Tribune Staff Reporter  kvirgil@tribunemedia.net  PRIME Minister Perry Christie said yesterday the government plans to simultaneously rebuild the hurricane-ravaged Family Islands where an estimated 836 homes were completely destroyed.  Mr Christie said based on information from the Department of Social Services, Hurricane Joaquin wiped out 413 homes in Long Island, 227 houses in San Salvador, 123 homes in Acklins, 50 houses in Crooked Island and 23 residences in Rum Cay.  However, Mr Christie suggested that the numbers could increase as teams continue to assess the damage to homes and provide assistance to impacted and displaced families.  Last week, the nation’s leader said an initial estimate of the costs of damage due to Hurricane Joaquin was already at $60m and was expected to rise as the additional assessments came into the Ministry of Finance.  While he has stated the government will most likely borrow money to assist with rebuilding, he revealed yesterday that the government has received grants to assist with the effort. The most recent grant was $1.7m from the Japanese government through its Japanese Aid Programme.  The prime minister yesterday spoke about this matter in the House of Assembly and the progress made on the southern and central islands since the passage of the category four storm earlier this month.  “This is a continuing exercise,” Mr Christie said, “and based on their (the assessors) findings, the government will respond in kind as a part of the work of the National Restoration and Recovery Unit. This will be done in the shortest possible time as the primary consideration of my government is to house and restore the physical comforts of our citizens.”  He continued: “Mr Speaker, I have met personally with the leaders of these teams, the engineers from the Ministry of Works and all the technical people of the government with the view to indicating that the intention of the government, Mr Speaker, which is to restore these matters in the shortest possible time and that we want to have a comprehensive approach to restoration, not one island at a time, but all islands at the same time.  “So, Mr Speaker, I expect as these teams come in that works will commence, in fact work has already commenced on some islands.”  The Department of Housing, he said, has provided designs of houses constructed following previous hurricanes, however, the foundation designs have to be adjusted to account for higher flood levels experienced during Hurricane Joaquin. Local contractors will be given the opportunity to construct the homes in the various Family Islands.  Mr Christie said as the efforts begin, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has purchased five “homes on wheels” that can each accommodate three adults or two adults and two children. Additionally seven mobile trailer homes were procured that are able to accommodate six to 10 persons.  The temporary units will be assigned to families and government employees on the affected islands who have been displaced due to the destruction of their homes or rental units while the construction of permanent replacements are completed.  Telecommunications  Immediately after the passage of Hurricane Joaquin, BTC discovered that 59 of its cell sites were off line that negatively affected 59 communities in the central and southern islands.  However, over the last two weeks, BTC has been able to restore services to all islands except south Long Island where two cell sites are down in the settlements of Roses and Mortimer’s. This is due to downed poles that are hindering the restoration of normal services, Mr Christie said.  He said at the moment there are no fixed Internet services to the south of Clarence Town, but work is continuing.  In Acklins, all sites are still down and dishes have been destroyed. Mr Christie said in Lovely Bay residents are able to make cellular calls using the site at Crooked Island. Also in Long Cay the dish on the cell tower needs to be re-aligned.  Family Island airports  The Department of Civil Aviation, Mr Christie said, has confirmed that all airports in the islands affected by Hurricane Joaquin are open for normal operations, although some terminal buildings suffered damage.  The last to be re-opened was Deadman’s Cay Airport in Long Island, which was opened for service on October 9.  He said the Department of Civil Aviation is continuing to carry out assessments on the conditions of the airports in the affected areas with a view towards any immediate remediation that may be necessary.  Social Services  In the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, Mr Christie said the Department of Social Services deployed four teams consisting of 14 social workers to conduct rapid initial damage assessments and assist with distribution of food and water to the severely affected islands.  The team deployed to Rum Cay conducted assessments on 29 homes, but were unable to process any of the winter residents whose homes may have been affected. He said the social workers are still compiling data on the number of residents by gender – this includes 10 school age children.  In San Salvador the team assessed 216 homes and counted 62 unoccupied homes. There are 227 students on the island, however, five have relocated to the capital.  During assessments in Crooked Island, the department processed 25 homes. Sixteen people remain in the clinic, as their homes are inhabitable.  There are seven homes remaining in Long Cay, which had 24 persons.  Mr Christie said long-term accommodations need to be identified for them along with the other residents whose homes were destroyed or severely damaged.  In Acklins, social workers completed 107 assessments. This does not include the persons whose homes were destroyed. They are in the process of compiling their data.  A team was deployed for Long Island on October 5. The team reported that the island was severely damaged which resulted in many homes being destroyed.  Mr Christie said it was difficult for the social workers to obtain an accurate count of all the families and homes that were affected by Hurricane Joaquin. However, they continue to process and compile information on the number of men, women and children affected.  Mr Christie said with respect to the restoration and recovery of vital state owned infrastructure, the Ministry of Works and its Urban Planning Department has completed its initial survey of damage, including roads, causeways and bridges and other government installations, including schools, clinics, and official residences.  He said he was in the process of analysing this report to decide on further action.  Staff from the Ministry of Housing are currently reviewing the assessments and compiling lists of building materials required for repairs in the affected islands.  Mr Christie said NEMA is also sourcing building materials which will be shipped to the Family Islands to be distributed to persons who have requested and qualified for assistance with building materials only or for building materials and labour.  The Royal Bahamas Defence Force will assist with some of the smaller repairs and NEMA is compiling a list of contractors and skilled construction craftsmen in the various Family Islands who will be able to assist with labour for repairs.  The technical staff of the Disaster Recovery and Reconstruction Unit with the help of other government agencies is compiling the list of homes that will have to be constructed to accommodate those persons whose homes were destroyed and have no source of permanent shelter.  Mr Christie said it is expected that there will be a close liaison between all of these engineering teams to ensure that there is no overlapping and more importantly that nothing falls between the cracks.\n",

      "As many as 2,214 households have been affected by the rainstorms in Rio Grande do Sul, the Emergency Management Service reported today (Dec. 28). A total of 1,964 households were displaced. The storms hit forty municipalities.  According to the government of Rio Grande do Sul, the State Coordination for Emergency Management continues to monitor and provide assistance to the impacted municipalities and communities.  Last Saturday (26), President Rousseff flew over the region, which borders Argentina and Uruguay, and announced the provision of $6.6 million to help communities hit by the floods.  This has been the fifth flood this year in the state, and the most severe. The Quaraí river rose a record 15.28 meters. The situation got even worse with the rise of the Uruguay river.  The rainstorm has disrupted rice harvest in the municipality of Quaraí and caused the Quaraí-Artigas international bridge between Brazil and Uruguay to remain closed off for 22 hours.

      "ESSA TWP. – Victims of the June tornado which tore through Angus don't qualify for provincial funding under the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program.  Essa Township Mayor Terry Dowdall received a letter to that effect from the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing earlier this month.  “Unfortunately, the province said with our ability to pay and the state of the municipality, because it is in good shape, that we can just afford to eat that,” Dowdall said. “I'm quite disappointed. I know Premier (Kathleen) Wynne was up here. She saw the devastation, the damage.”  The June 17 tornado whipped through Essa Township around the supper hour, leaving 100 families homeless while others had to clean up downed trees and debris.  The EF2 tornado left a 13-kilometre track of destruction - beginning in south Angus, crossing Essa Township and eventually ending due east in the Essa and Athabaska roads area of south Barrie. An EF2 tornado can blow off roofs and uproot trees with wind speeds of 180 to 220 kilometres an hour.  Within hours of the storm, Dowdall had declared a state of emergency and brought in Essa Township emergency departments staff, as well Simcoe County administrators, to assist the 300 people displaced by the storm.  Dowdall said approximately $140,000 has been raised by the community for disaster relief, and he was hoping for two-to-one provincial funding, but would have accepted one-to-one.  Intead, Essa is getting none-to-one.  “We all pitch in, we all pay for part of that fund, all Ontarians, and there certainly was enough damage up here that I think council was of the belief, and the residents were of the belief, that the province should have came forward,” Dowdall said.  “I'm kind of at a bitter loss for words how they don't see even one-to-one funding, to help out these residents, to get their lives back on track.”  A letter from Ontario Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Ted McMeekin said the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program is designed to restore essential municipal infrastructure or private property to its pre-disaster condition, so communities can get back on their feet.  Factors include the nature and impact of the disaster on the community, the municipality's ability to pay for damage repairs and the degree of insurance coverage.  “I understand that most of the residents impacted by the tornado had insurance coverage and your excellent fund-raising efforts will be able to support those few residents in your community who may have uninsured losses,” said McMeekin in the letter.  Essa Township was also looking for approximately $55,000 in municipal damages, which Dowdall said was to pay for staff overtime associated with the tornado.  That request was turned down too.  “As these costs represent approximately 1% of your tax revenue this seems well within the ability of the municipality to manage,” McMeekin said.  “We weren't asking for the world. I was a bit shocked,” Dowdall said of the ministry's rejection. “It certainly took a little bit of the wind out of the sails.”  He said Simcoe-Grey MPP Jim Wilson is going to raise the matter with the Ontario government.  But Wilson is a Progressive Conservative, and it's a majority Liberal government that Ontarians elected June 12.  “That's part of, probably, the dynamics of our application, perhaps, which I would hope's not the nature,” Dowdall said, “but I guess that's for others to decide, to read into that.  “From my perspective, when I see what they (the province) have spent a lot of money on, this (fund) is something really to help the grassroots people in the community and even $140,000 on one-to-one isn't a lot in the grand scheme of things.”  Dowdall said the only good news from the province's rejection is the money which has been raised can be dispersed. Previously, it had to held to get those matching dollars.  “We're just holding onto it in trust, we're not actually the ones who are going to divvy it up,” he said. “There's a committee that's going to decide how to do that.  “The community just rallied. The businesses and all the residents just rallied to raise this money, with the hopes that the province would match.”  Asked Thursday how much money was in the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program, a Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing spokesman said the government does not have a set budget for it.

      "CHAD (23 Aug.) - Thousands of homes collapsed and schools were damaged in camp Mile for Sudanese refugees in eastern Chad due to heavy rains that struck the region on Thursday.  Sheikh Abbakar Abdullah Al Doum Tajouri, spokesman for the camp’s refugees, told Radio Dabanga that “torrential rains led to the destruction of 2,082 houses. In addition, eight schools were damaged, including desks, books, pamphlets, and stationery. Rains also uprooted 178 trees.”  According to the sheikh, the affected families are currently living in the open. He has asked the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and other agencies to expedite the provision of tents, tarpaulins, blankets, and food.  Heavy rainfall also injured two people, including an elderly woman, in refugee camp Kariari in eastern Chad.  A sheikh told Radio Dabanga that 800 houses were destroyed by rain and that a number of cattle were killed by floods that “washed the region.”  He is calling upon humanitarian organisations to expedite the provision of aid to dozens of families which do not have shelter, food, or medicine.\n",

      "While conditions were not favourable for wildfires in most areas of the country in 2014, it was still a huge wildfire year in Canada. According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, although the absolute number of wildland fires was 10 per cent less than the 20-year average, the area burned was three times higher than the 20-year national average (4.6 million hectares vs. the normal 1.5 million hectares). So even with parts of Canada being, at times, soaked by heavy rains or underwater from floods, the Northwest Territories and British Columbia made up for it all with exceptional warmth and dryness that brought sparks to infernos in no time flat.  ©Environment Canada  In the Northwest Territories it started with a cold winter and scanty snows that left the ground and forest litter dry. With summer came clear skies and record warm temperatures that optimized already perfect conditions for fires to spread. The principal culprit was a stalled ridge of drying air anchored over the Mackenzie River valley for weeks. Temperatures from Tuktoyaktuk to Yellowknife averaged well above historic averages. The Mackenzie region averaged 1.6°C warmer than normal – the seventh warmest summer in 67 years. Yellowknife had 22 days in June and July at or above 25°C, compared to an average of eight, and only two days in June and three in July with rain. In a 91-day span, from the May long-weekend onwards, Yellowknife received only one-half its normal rainfall. As further evidence of the dryness, water levels in the Mackenzie River dropped to some of the lowest seen in more than 30 years. So it was no surprise to anyone that the Northwest Territories had its worst fire season in 30 years with nearly 3.4 million hectares razed. That’s seven times the normal acreage consumed and six times the size of Prince Edward Island. At the peak of the fire season, smoke, ash and moisture from intense fires travelled as high as 15 km in the air, easily circling the globe. Some plumes travelled south and east affecting air quality in the northern plains of the United States, the Canadian Maritimes and even as far as Portugal. The fires caused a host of problems, including highway closures due to reduced visibility, the destruction of fibre optic cables and the interruption of Yellowknife’s main power supply line. Health risks were also a concern as the city’s hospital treated twice the usual number of patients for respiratory and allergy issues. Smoke was so thick that, at times, it was hard to breathe indoors with the windows closed let alone venturing outside. Widespread forest fires also stranded visitors and adversely affected busy tourist camps and attractions. In August, firefighters and residents finally got a breather when cooler and wetter weather took hold. Temperatures dropped significantly and rainfall was 50 per cent more than normal for the month.  ©Environment Canada  In British Columbia, an overheated wildfire season scorched the third-biggest loss of timber in the province since authorities began recording wildfire statistics more than 60 years ago. Fires burned more than 338,000 hectares through the province – seven and a half times the normal area charred on average over 20 years. No homes or notable structures were destroyed, but the province more than quadrupled its firefighting budget, spending $266 million. Conditions for the wildfire season started in 2013 when places like Victoria experienced their driest October-to-December on record. Summer perfected conditions for igniting and spreading wildfires as average temperature across coastal and southern portions of the province made for the third-warmest summer over 67 years of record-keeping and one of the top ten driest summers. Record-high July maximum temperatures soared into the low 40s in several interior communities. Some places claimed it was the driest summer in more than half a century. Among the major fires were those that burned in vast dead pine forests killed by mountain pine beetles or on steep, inaccessible terrain, increasing risks and challenges to firefighters and communities. Nearly 400 firefighters from Ontario, the Maritimes, Alaska and even Australia pitched in to help. The biggest and most difficult forest fire was near the Chelaslie River south of Burns Lake in northwestern British Columbia. It burned 133,162 hectares, accounting for more than 30 per cent of land burned in the province this year. Another big fire occurred in northern British Columbia near the Alberta border when a lightning strike whipped by strong winds caused 3,800 hectares to burn at Red Deer Creek. And a fire at Smith Creek, west of Kelowna, forced 2,500 people out of their homes. Over the course of the summer a series of smoke advisories and special air quality statements, issued by the province and Environment Canada respectively, were put in place for many regions, including the Okanagan Valley where residents of Peachland were urged to keep small children, the elderly and pets inside. On occasion, even Vancouver and the Fraser Valley were subject to air quality advisories as smoke plumes hung heavy over the skies.  ©Environment Canada  Fortunately, timely rains and cool temperatures from September through October saved British Columbia from a second disastrous forest fire season and brought much-needed moisture to the somewhat water-starved province. Rainfall in Victoria and Vancouver totalled more than 40 per cent above normal, with Vancouver experiencing its wettest September-October in 10 years.\n",

      "For the past several years, flooding has been the big story across the Prairie provinces. In 2005, torrential rains produced summer flooding. In 2011, it was the combination of snowmelt and ice jamming that created a massive billion-dollar disaster across Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Last year, the coincidence of rapid snowmelt and heavy spring rains in southern Alberta generated the most disruptive, destructive and expensive flood in Canadian history – a $6 billion flood of floods. Unfortunately, anyone looking for a break in 2014 was sorely disappointed. This time water problems prevailed across the eastern Prairies just a week before summer began. Excessive rains on soggy ground − too much rain too fast over too many days – led to huge flooding and another billion-dollar disaster.  ©Environment Canada  On June 15, two major slow-moving weather systems, hours apart and more typical of spring or fall, combined to bring a few soggy days to the eastern Prairies. The prolonged moisture-laden storms moved up from the northern United States and stalled near the Saskatchewan-Manitoba border. Relentless rains turned into biblical-sized deluges over three days. Almost a year’s worth of rain fell in some places. Prior to the soaking, three weeks of wet weather meant that the latest rains had nowhere to go but overland. With soil saturated and ditches filled, the water cascaded into channels that rapidly fed into creeks and rivers.  Excess precipitation in the days and weeks leading up to July 1 included:  The third wettest spring on record dating back to 1892 for Saskatoon. Total spring (April to June) precipitation was 230 mm or 175 per cent of normal.  Yorkton had 252 mm of rain in June, which was more than triple the normal accumulation and the wettest ever since 1884 when record-keeping began. Nine days in June had more than 10 mm (normal is 2 days) and spring rainfall totalled 357 mm – another record.  With observations at Brandon dating back to the 1890s, June 2014 was the wettest month ever with 252 mm – three times June’s normal total and, incredibly, 34 mm higher than the all-time previous wettest month of August 1980. June had four days with rainfall over 25 mm, including 75 mm on June 19, and three days in a row on the final weekend of the month – all on top of it being Brandon’s wettest spring on record.  One Regina weather site recorded 198 mm of rain in June, which is nearly triple the normal of 70 mm and almost the wettest month on record. Total April-to-June rainfall was 312 mm or 216 per cent of normal, and the second wettest such period with records dating back to 1883.  To the far west, Lethbridge recorded its wettest June and wettest month ever with 280 mm of rain, which is more rain than the city gets in an average year.  ©Environment Canada  Rains and subsequent flooding at the end of June forced the closure of a hundred highways, including a stretch of the TransCanada east of Regina where dozens of bridges, culverts and utilities were washed away and dozens of basements were filled. Sections of country roads were under water for days on end. The rains also led to record flows on 17 southern Manitoba rivers and streams. Nearly 100 communities, including the cities of Melville and Yorkton in Saskatchewan, declared states of emergency. Citizen volunteers and a thousand military reservists scrambled to fill hundreds of thousands of sandbags to fend off rising floodwaters. Some 1,000 residents, mainly in southwestern Manitoba, were displaced and faced mucky basements and debris-strewn yards on their return home.  ©Environment Canada  Flooded pastures resembled rice paddies and crop fields featured lakes with whitecaps, leaving some of the best farmland in Canada too soggy to farm. Farmers feared losing their growing season altogether. In Manitoba and Saskatchewan, well over one million acres of seeded fields were flooded or drowned and another two million were left unseeded. As much as six million acres of farmland in the west were damaged, drowned or lying on still-frozen ground. Even though some crops recovered from flooding, their high yields suffered. Total costs from flooding exceeded $1 billion as farmers lost crops and communities mopped up. Weeks later, waves of mosquitoes emerged from the sodden ground and standing waters. Hardship was especially prevalent in several First Nations communities where flooding is becoming a ritual that brings both emotional and physical health issues.  The seeds of this summer’s flood started in the fall of 2013, when already saturated soils, combined with high over-winter snowfall covered the eastern Prairies. It was magnified by an exceptionally hard winter with a deep snowpack and a late spring melt that kept soils saturated and potholes filled. Another factor leading to worsening Prairie flooding in recent years that has been brought to light by expert hydrometeorologists is altered drainage patterns on agricultural lands in Saskatchewan and Manitoba and the greater incidence of multi-day rainfalls. Storm rainfalls over larger areas are lasting longer than usual. The network of Prairie potholes and sloughs has already filled to the brim, and now the runoffs are moving overland in a “fill and spill process” that is ripping out roads, inundating homes and overwhelming sewer networks. Ducks Unlimited said that wetland drainage on the Prairies has increased average flows by more than 60 per cent, and a study by the University of Saskatchewan found changes in wetland drainage over 50 years increased recent flood peaks by as much as 32 per cent.\n",

      "1. Frost Quakes  Much of southern and eastern Ontario and Quebec was abuzz between Christmas and the first week of January after hearing, hearing about or feeling loud banging noises and tremors. Police and media were inundated with calls from the worried to the curious about what most thought were falling trees, sonic booms, gunshots or earthquake activity. In actual fact, they were experiencing what scientists called cryoseisms or “frost quakes” that are the result of freezing water splitting deep soil or rock or causing frost heaving. The sudden expansion of the water in frozen soil or rocks puts stress on the ground and the ensuing cracking, vibrating and booming noise can easily be mistaken for earthquakes and gunshots. Frost quakes are louder if the ground is saturated from previous rains, snowmelt or flooding and there is little snow cover to muffle the sound. They are best heard between midnight and dawn when sound travels better in cold air, there is less background noise and winds are lighter.  2. Freezing Rain Frightens Torontonians  An intensifying low over Arkansas brought 15 to 20 cm of snow east of Lake Huron and significant freezing rain to areas north of lakes Erie and Ontario over January 5-6. Residents in the Greater Toronto Area were especially nervous about the possible repeat of the pre-Christmas ice storm they had just weathered. What they got instead was a brief shot of freezing rain, with hardly any accretion on trees or hydro lines but enough of a coating to make roads treacherous during the commute. Adding to the misery was a dramatic drop in temperature by 17 degrees that created a flash freeze and black ice.  3. Province-wide Whiteouts  A surprise, fast-moving wall of snow caused highway havoc right across southern Ontario on February 27. Huge pileups – three 30-vehicle messes in southwestern Ontario alone – and white-knuckle driving were typical scenes. North of Toronto there was a 96-vehicle pileup on Highway 400. Amid blinding snow, the OPP closed all roads in Huron, Bruce and Perth counties, which led to a kind of reverse snow day as kids were left stuck at school overnight or billeted out.  4. Spring Flooding in First Nations Communities  The threat of rising flood waters on the Albany River and sewer back-ups forced the evacuation of 2,000 residents in the northern Ontario First Nation communities of Kashechewan and Attawapiskat around May 11, where 40 homes and buildings were damaged by sewage and flood waters. In total, eight communities in Ontario’s far north came under states of emergency, including Moosonee, mostly due to rising waters.  5. Another Two-Tornado Day  On June 24 at around 3:30 p.m., an EF1 tornado moved through the community of Laurel Station to the northwest of Orangeville. Peak winds associated with the tornado were between 135 and 175 km/h – strong enough to move a residential vehicle three metres, un-roof a few homes and down several trees. A half-hour later another EF1 tornado struck east of Tottenham. The twister prompted several road closures and damaged a riding stable where it killed a horse.  6. Burlington Rain Gusher  A band of thunderstorms generating massive rains developed in a line from Freelton to Burlington late on August 4. While rainfall amounts of 100 to 150 mm were estimated by radar, an amateur weather observer recorded a highly localized amount of 190 mm – a two-month supply – in four hours. The heavy rain flooded basements and intersections and forced the closure of many roads including Highways 403, 407 and the Queen Elizabeth Way, or QEW. On some roads water reached above the roofs of vehicles, forcing motorists and passengers to swim to safety. The deluge backed up storm drains, caused mudslides and creeks to overflow, and left standing water on 300 properties and in 500 basements. Burlington’s Mayor claimed it was the worst flooding he’d seen in 20 years. Illustrative of how targeted Burlington was, Hamilton recorded no rain, 3 mm fell at Toronto Pearson, Toronto Island got 1 mm and Vineland received 1.3 mm. Damages from flooding were estimated in excess of $90 million.  7. August Deluges in Windsor  A slow-moving storm crossed the Detroit River into Canada on August 11. Torrential downpours in excess of 70 mm over a 10-hour span fell in Windsor and district, filling basements and swamping yards and streets. It was a month’s worth of rain and the second-highest rain total ever recorded at the airport during August. About a week later, another powerful storm ripped through Windsor bringing down huge tree branches and tossing around backyard gazebos that were bolted down in concrete. An Environment Canada storm team later confirmed that at least two EF0 tornadoes touched down − the first in south Windsor and the second northeast of Harrow.  8. Not Buffalo-Sized Snows  Strong cold winds and relatively warm waters off the Great Lakes combined to produce intense snow squalls on November 19-20. The strongest affected regions were near Georgian Bay where the weather system remained nearly stationary for several hours, dumping snow amounts of 90 cm near Parry Sound, 40 cm in Huntsville, and 20 cm in Bracebridge and Barrie. While the numbers were impressive, they had nothing on the close to 200+ cm that fell in similar lake-effect storms over Buffalo, New York. Back in Ontario, multiple collisions on Highway 400 north of Toronto blocked north-south lanes south of Barrie, causing lengthy delays.  9. Down On the Farm  By late September, it was highly unusual to see fields of Ontario corn and soybeans still unharvested. September also featured twice the usual amount of rain, which kept good field and harvest days to a minimum. Fortunately, in late September and October, Ontario experienced warmer weather that allowed the harvest to progress. Still, in mid-November – with early winter cold, snow and winds − half of Ontario’s grain crop remained in the ground. The Ontario Ministry of Food and Agriculture said it was the latest harvest over a broad area of the province since 1992 – so late that the delayed corn harvest cut into winter wheat planting.  10. November Gales  Unseasonably warm air from Texas, along with powerful 100 km/h winds, whipped through Ontario on November 24 leaving 87,000 hydro customers in the dark. In some places between Windsor and Kingston, trees were ripped right out of the ground – roots and all. Just prior to the warmth and winds came heavy rains that flooded streets and forced road closures. Temperatures soared between St. Catharines and Ottawa to record heights, including 21°C in Cornwall. Blowing winds broke hydro poles, felled trees, shattered bus shelters and left traffic lights dangling.\n",

      "Etiquetas  Santiago de Chile, 1 ene.- Un incendio forestal destruyó hoy 24 viviendas y obligó a evacuar un centenar de casas en el cerro San Roque, del puerto chileno de Valparaíso, que además ha dejado varios lesionados y ha arrasado con diez hectáreas de vegetación, informaron las autoridades.  El fuego, de acuerdo con informes preliminares de la policía, habría sido causado por niños que manipulaban fuegos de artificio en ese sector de Valparaíso, a 120 kilómetros al oeste de Santiago.  El gobernador del principal puerto chileno, José Pedro Núñez, señaló que por el momento se está preparando la habilitación de un albergue para las familias damnificadas por el incendio, cuya propagación fue favorecida por el intenso calor reinante en la zona y en general en el centro y norte de Chile.  En el asunto también trabaja la secretaria regional de Desarrollo Social, María de los Ángeles De la Paz, dijo Núñez en declaraciones al canal 24Horas, en las que indicó además que cerca de un centenar de casas han sido evacuadas por precaución.  En el control de las llamas participaron bomberos, brigadas de la Corporación Nacional Forestal (Conaf) y personal municipal, dijo por su parte, al mismo medio, el alcalde de Valparaíso, Jorge Castro.  Al lugar concurrieron también bomberos de algunas localidades cercanas, además de un avión y un helicóptero cuya principal función fue evitar la propagación del fuego.  \"El trabajo ha sido dificultoso porque la parte baja del incendio es una quebrada muy profunda con muy difíciles accesos\", dijo por su parte a los periodistas el director regional de la Oficina Nacional de Emergencia (Onemi), Guillermo de la Maza.  Agregó que unas 25 personas han sido atendidos en puestos médicos de avanzada \"por distintas afectaciones, todas leves\",precisando que hay una persona con heridas por cortes por con trozos de lata y cinco con deficiencias respiratorias, aunque no hay heridos graves.  Entre los lesionados se cuentan también ocho bomberos, pero todos ellos leves, acotó.  La región de Valparaíso ha sido afectada por varios incendios desde el pasado lunes y hoy se mantenían activos, según la policía, focos de fuego en Peñuelas, junto a la autopista que une a Valparaíso con Santiago, en Villa Alemana, en Quintero y en el sector de Belloto Norte del municipio de Quilpué.\n",

      "Flood and landslide in Brazil  Type of Event: Flood and landslide Location of Event: Brazil Date of Charter Activation: 14 June 2014 Charter Requestor: Brazilian Disaster and Risk Management National Centre (CENAD) Project Management: INPE  Description of the event  Torrential rainfall, between 07 and 10 June 2014, has caused flooding in southern Brazil where it is estimated that approximately half a million people have been affected.  The weather followed a cold front that passed over the states of Santa Catarina and Paraná, which brought strong winds with the rain. Paraná state has been the worst affected, where ten people have been killed and six were reported missing. Over 130 cities have been affected by the disaster and it was estimated that 40,000 people were evacuated.  Of particular concern was the Paraná River, which burst its banks in places. The rising water level on the river also caused flooding in neighbouring Argentina, and the floodgates at the Yacyreta Dam were opened on 11 June to help control the floodwaters. The dam is located on the border of Argentina, and it was reported that record levels of water passed through the dam.  Floodwaters and landslides have blocked some roads and destroyed bridges, cutting off easy access to some of the affected towns.  The rain was forecast to finish on 15 June, leaving emergency workers with the task of recovering from the flooding.\n",

      "Media caption A factory worker is rescued moments before a building is washed away  A landslide has buried between 30 and 40 people in China's Sichuan province following heavy rain, state media say.  Rescue workers with search dogs are at the scene in the city of Dujiangyan, Xinhua news agency reports.  On Tuesday a bridge collapsed in the nearby city of Jiangyou, leaving at least 12 people missing.  Days of heavy rain and floods have damaged hundreds of homes and forced the evacuation of more than 36,000 people in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.  Footage from Chinese state media, meanwhile, showed the dramatic rescue of a factory worker in the town of Deyang, who was stranded by the floods after the factory was washed away.  \"The water level is so high that vehicles, forklifts and excavators have all been washed away,\" Wei Xiao, another factory worker, told Reuters news agency.  Mud and landslides caused by flooding and strong rains are common in China's mountainous areas, killing hundreds of people every year. Deforestation has also made soil erosion much more of a problem.  'Evacuated'  The landslide occurred in the town of Zhongxing is Dujiangyan - one of the places badly hit by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.  The landslide, which covered about 2 sq km (0.8 sq miles), damaged at least 11 homes, Xinhua reported.  \"So far we only know 11 families were buried and more than 200 residents have been evacuated,\" a local official told AFP news agency.  Patrol members in Dujiangyan told local media that by the time they arrived at the scene, a few hours after the landslide, \"everything was already a vast expanse of water\".  Eyewitnesses described stones and debris running down the hill and covering around eight homes in less than three minutes.  Meanwhile, rescue teams have been deployed in Jiangyou to search for those missing after Qinglian bridge collapsed, state media said.  At least six vehicles were reported to have plunged into the river when it came down after days of heavy rain.  Jiangyou's local government say the river volume suddenly increased to a 50-year high on Tuesday.  \"The high levels of flood sediment, and strong and destructive force of the water, caused the Qinglian bridge to collapse,\" it said.  Two other bridges, one in Jiangyou and one in Deyang, were also washed away, officials said.  Chinese officials said that the heavy rain had affected more than 500,000 people in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, damaged about 300 homes, and forced the evacuation of 36,800 people, Xinhua reported.  For the worst affected areas, it appears that there is going to be little respite, says the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing.  Heavy rainfall is forecast in Sichuan province over the next 24 hours, our correspondent adds.  In 2011, more than five million people were reported to be affected by deadly floods in eastern China.  In 2008, Sichuan was hit by a devastating earthquake which led to almost 90,000 people dead or missing. A swollen river has wrecked exhibits at a memorial to those who died.\n",

The flooding has spread to other provinces in southern and central China. Initially the floods struck in Guangdong, Guizhou, Hunan and Jiangxi, but areas affected now include Chongqing, Sichuan, Yunnan, Fujian and Guangxi.  The severe weather appears to have moved northwards and it is the central province of Hunan that is currently experiencing some of the worst of the flooding. Authorities issued a red alert flood warning after many parts of the proviince saw long periods of heavy rain.  A total of 5.51 million people have been affected in total Around 75,000 houses have either been damaged or destroyed and 447,000 people displaced.  As expected, the death toll has also risen from 19 to 37. This figure may again be revised upwards after authorities have had chance to thoroughly assess the situations. As of early today 27 May 2014, there are some initial reports claiming that the death toll could go up to 45 after 8 more fatalities were recoded in Hunan. 6 people are still missing in floods across the region.  Guangdong has suffered the worst of the flooding, where 17 people have died so far and 3 people remain missing in the province.

      "Update: 6 June, 2014  Situation and response  On 24 and 30 May respectively, 5.6 and 6.1 magnitude earthquakes jolted Yingjiang County in southwest China's Yunnan Province, injuring 45 people. More than 3,000 houses were destroyed and 21,000 severely damaged, while 90,000 houses were moderately damaged, forcing the evacuation of a further 45,000 people. About 210,000 people were affected. The two earthquakes were only 2km apart, which made the damage more severe.  The local government has already arranged for quilts, tents, foldable beds with mattresses and more to be sent to the quake-affected area to meet the basic needs of the quake survivors. Due to the hot weather in the quake zone, mosquitoes can easily grow and spread diseases in the relocation area. Mosquito nets are in urgent need. As there is currently no electricity in the quake zone, lighting at night is a problem which poses a safety issue for the survivors.  Oxfam has been conducting on-site needs assessments in the severely affected townships with the support of our local partners. After the initial assessment, Oxfam’s office in Kunming has collaborated with a partner organisation, the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Center of Yunnan Province, to provide6,000 mosquito nets, 3,000 boxes of mosquito repellent and 3,000 torches to three of the quake-stricken townships in the zone: Kachang, Sudian and Mengnong. These were delivered to survivors by 4 and 5 of June.\n",

      "JINGGU, Yunnan, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- A candlelight vigil was held early Wednesday morning as the body of 58-year-old Dao Qiongfen lay in a coffin.  Several hours before, the woman, the sole victim so far in a 6.6-magnitude quake that jolted southwest China's Yunnan Province at 9:49 p.m. on Tuesday, was still fast asleep.  \"When it happened, I had been sleeping for half an hour already,\" said Qiongfen's grieving husband, Dao Wenguang, from Mangla Village of Yongping Town, five kilometers away from the epicenter.  Feeling the tremor, Dao Wenguang and their children soon fled the house. \"But I didn't see her, and there was no reply when we called her name,\" the man said.  Dao Qiongfen was later found under a collapsed wall, unable to breathe and her waist broken.  As of 11 a.m. Wednesday, about 13 hours after the earthquake in Jinggu County, Pu'er, at least one person was dead and 324 others were injured, including eight in critical condition.  A total of 124,600 people from five counties and districts were affected, and some 58,980 people were evacuated. The quake also toppled 6,988 buildings and damaged 13,842 more.  In Mangla Village, where many villagers, like Dao, are of the Dai ethnic minority group, a Xinhua reporter saw cracks on buildings. Some adobe walls had collapsed, and broken bricks and tiles were scattered in the streets.  Villagers spent the night outside, and dozens of tents were pitched.  In nearby Mangfei Village, people gathered on a basketball court. They sat around a bonfire during the cold night.  According to Liu Wei, most of the wounded in his village suffered head and shoulder injuries.  SECOND QUAKE  It was the second strong quake to hit the province in a little over two months. A 6.5-magnitude quake with a depth of 12 kilometers struck Ludian County on August 3, killing at least 615 people.  Although the focal depth of Tuesday's quake was relatively shallow at five kilometers and the quake occurred when many were in bed, it appears to have caused fewer casualties than the August quake so far.  Wang Bin, vice head of the Yunnan provincial seismological bureau, said many buildings in the area featured wooden mortise riveting structures, making them relatively quake-proof.  \"In Jinggu, nearly 20,000 out of 60,000 rural households have improved the quality of their houses to meet the standard for shock-resistance,\" said Wang Tianshou, head of the housing and urban-rural development bureau in the county.  The lower intensity of the quake, lower population density in the quake-hit zone, and concentration of residences in flatter, less mountainous areas also led to fewer casualties.  Li Chunguang, head of the science and technology department of the bureau, said the two quakes happened along different seismic belts and had no direct connections.  Li said the province has entered a seismically active period, but further study is needed to predict whether there will be major earthquakes in the near future.\n",

The tremors in seismically unstable Yongshan County in Yunnan Province began at 6.40 am local time on Saturday. Authorities say the epicenter of the quake was 13 km below the ground surface.  \"We felt the quake strongly, but it did not last long,\" a local resident recounted to Xinhua news agency.  Authorities say that 2,731 houses have been damaged and 75 have collapsed – mostly shacks made from stamped soil.  21,000 people have been evacuated to tent camps, but electricity and communications are continuing to function normally.  Mountainous Yunnan and bordering Sichuan provinces suffer deadly annual earthquakes, with the 8.0-magnitude 2008 earthquake in Sichuan resulting in the deaths of over 70,000 people.  Larger casualties were avoided this time due to the low population density in the affected area, and the unusually deep epicenter, in a place where tremors usually originate less than 5 km from the surface.  According to Chinese media, some locals have linked the event to the Xiluodu hydropower plant – the second biggest in China – located less than 15 km away. While huge amounts of water stored in rivers above the plants have been known to trigger seismic activity, the government has denied that the latest incident has any connection to the Xiluodu facility, which remains undamaged.\n",
