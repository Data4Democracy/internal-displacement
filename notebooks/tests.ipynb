Israeli forces have continued their aerial, ground and sea attacks throughout the Gaza Strip, causing more civilian casualties and damaging civilian facilities. Israeli forces escalated their attacks throughout the Gaza Strip. Electricity supplies have been off in the Gaza Strip for the 4th consecutive day.  Municipalities face extreme difficulties in their work due to the lack of fuel supplies and because if Israeli attacks.
