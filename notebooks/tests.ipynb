Israeli forces have continued their aerial, ground and sea attacks throughout the Gaza Strip, causing more civilian casualties and damaging civilian facilities. Israeli forces escalated their attacks throughout the Gaza Strip. Electricity supplies have been off in the Gaza Strip for the 4th consecutive day.  Municipalities face extreme difficulties in their work due to the lack of fuel supplies and because if Israeli attacks.  These developments raise concerns regarding public health in Gaza Strip, which is one of the most densely populated areas in the world.  The crisis has further aggravated as at least 400,000 civilians were forcibly displaced from their homes, and were forced to resort to shelters in the centers of towns and refugee camps.    PCHR field workers have been unable to collect information from border areas in the Gaza Strip, because the situation is extremely dangerous in these areas.  Details of the crime that took place in Rafah, which left dozens of deaths, while this update was being written will be published in tomorrow’s update.  The following details are based on the information which the field workers have been able to collect.
