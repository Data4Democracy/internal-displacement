      "Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warned the storm remained \"very serious\" and urged the public in affected areas to remain indoors amid the threat of flooding and high winds, which have brought down trees and caused some damage to homes.  During a press conference, she said the storm system was now moving south along the coast from the town of Yeppoon towards Rockhampton, which lies 595 kilometers (370 miles) north of Brisbane, the state capital.  Around 33,000 households in the area are now without power, she said, warning that this number was likely to grow as the day progresses.  \"It is still a dangerous cyclone. We are heartened that it has reduced from a (Category) five to a four, but ... it is heading towards Rockhampton, a heavily populated regional town in Queensland, and we want everyone to be safe. So stay in doors,\" Palaszczuk said.  Queensland's Bureau of Meteorology said the Yeppoon area, where some 800 people were forced into temporary shelters, had seen the most \"destructive winds\" after the storm made landfall at around 8 a.m. Friday (5 p.m. ET Thursday). But it said the winds would weaken further by the time it reached Rockhampton -- though Category 3 winds in excess of 100 kph (62 mph) were still destructive. #CycloneMarcia now Category 4. Very destructive winds still expected at the centre.

      "The Disaster Management Information System (DMIS) is a web-based working tool made accessible only to Red Cross and Red Crescent staff working in National Societies, delegations and Geneva headquarters. It is a system from which users will be able to access:  The DMIS project started in February 2001 as a follow up to Strategy 2010 and in response to the need for informed decisions, speed and efficient operational readiness. DMIS is the result of a major effort made by the Federation in addressing the complexity of information exchange in the humanitarian community and to support an efficient disaster preparedness and response for the whole Federation's Red Cross and Crescent network at a global level. DMIS continues in the same vein with the successor Strategy 2020.\n",

      "Costa Rica saw further heavy rainfall and flooding on Monday 06 July and Tuesday 07 July 2015. WMO report that Puerto Limon saw 174.9 mm of rain fall in 24 hours during that period. Costa Ricaâ€™s National Meteorological Institute have warned that the heavy rainfall will continue.  Costa Ricaâ€™s National Emergency Commission (ComisiÃ³n Nacional de PrevenciÃ³n de Riesgos y AtenciÃ³n de Emergencias â€“ CNE) issued a red alert for parts of Heredia and LimÃ³n provinces.  Authorities say that the rain and flooding has forced a total of 1057 people to evacuate thier homes and move to one of the 13 temporary shelters set up by CNE, many of them in local community halls or churches. Most of those displaced are in the canton of Sarapiqui.  As of 07 July 2015, 94 communities across 15 cantons were facing access problems after roads had been flooded or damaged.  This latest period of heavy rain means that parts of Costa Rica have suffered flooding for over 2 weeks. Floods in the Caribbean and Northern regions on 21 June 2015 left 25 communities isolated and hundreds displaced.  After a short respite, where some of those affected were able to return to thier homes, northern and eastern parts of the country were faced with further torrential rain on 27 June which caused damage to roads, bridges and houses, and affected over 200 communities across 3 provinces of LimÃ³n, Heredia and Cartago.  The heavy rain is continuing to fall in parts of northern Colombia and Venzuela, both of which have been hit by floods over the last 10 days. Over 50 mm of rain fell in 24 hours between 06 and 07 July in Arauca, Colombia, according to WMO. Guanare in Venezuela saw 53 mm of rain in the same period. A state of emergency was recently declared after heavy rain and floods in the state of Apure, Venezuela.\n",
