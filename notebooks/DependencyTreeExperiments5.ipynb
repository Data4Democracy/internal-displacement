    "CURRENT ALGORITHM:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm extracts facts (locations,dates,reporting terms, reporting units, and quantities) on a sentence by sentence basis, while using a working memory to store the most recently extracted set of locations and dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dates and locations are identified within each sentence if present. The most recently seen dates and locations are remembered, for use in sentences where they are absent but the other reporting elements are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm relies on lists of (a) reporting terms and (b) reporting units. These two lists are each subdivided into structure and person related tokens, giving a total of four lists. When extracting facts from a sentence, the algorithm checks each token within the sentence to see if it falls within one of these four lists. A token that falls within one of these lists is known as a root_node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm then attempts to find a suitable partner for this root_node. In order to ensure that tokens and units are appropriately matched (eg to prevent the creation of reports of houses being murdered), the type of the unit or term (ie person or structure) comprising the root_node is taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "The branch search algorithm accepts a root node and an appropriate list of partner tokens (determined by the term/unit person/structure nature of the root node). It searches for nodes either adjacent to or below the root_node within the sentence tree. If any of these nodes meet the partner token criteria, then the algorithim declares this node to be the partner_node of the root_node and proceeds to search for a number. The algorithm assumes that numbers will either be adjacent to or below the partner_node, with tokens below the partner_node being examined before adjacent tokens. Potential numbers are checked to ensure that they are not part of a previously identified date. \n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where the root node is a person reporting term, but no reporting units are detected, the possibility of implicit units is considered. The algorithim will look for a numeric token adjacent to or below the root_node, and assume that the reporting unit is \"person\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ISSUES:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentences with qualifiers between reporting terms and units can fail to produce reports eg \"Six people, including women and children, were reported as killed in the floods.\". We could solve this problem by creating a list of linkage words. If the head of the root_node is found to be such a word, the algorithm would begin its search for the partner_node at the linkage word token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentences with a \"reporting phrase\" rather than a reporting term, eg \"The report reads that the rains of March 28 and 29 left 2,160 people from Sumbe and Porto Amboim in a situation of dire need, as one was killed, three wounded and 150 houses destroyed, laving 483 homeless\" (with the reporting phrase in a situation of dire need) can be very problematic, since the algorithm fails to detect the appropriate reporting term, and potentially inappropriately links the reporting unit to another reporting term in the sentence (in this case it reports 2160 people killed)."

      "Message sent on behalf of Mr. Ignacio Leon-Garcia Head of OCHA Regional Office for Southern Africa  In Madagascar, Hellen continues to weakening, with maximum wind speeds of 55 km/h. At 09H00 local time (UTC+3) the weather system was located 250 km north-east of Morondava and is currently moving in a south-easterly direction into the Mozambique Channel. The National Bureau of Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC) have lifted all alerts. See attached map.  A multi-sector aerial assessment of the inaccessible districts of Soalalala, Mitsinjo and Besalampy identified damaged classrooms and flooded agricultural fields. There are reportedly needs in the sector of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), but most healthcare centres appear intact. The Prime Minister visited Soalala today, bringing relief items including water treatment products, medicines and cash.  Initial results indicate that 919 people have been displaced, of which some will be able to return home in the coming days. Over 170 houses were destroyed. Although local authorities have been quick to respond, it is expected that displaced families will need relief supplies (food, health and non-food item kits) to get through the coming weeks. WFP is dispatching one ton of high energy biscuits and 35 tons of foodstuffs to the operational base in Mahajanga where a 500 ton-capacity warehouse is open to all humanitarian partners.  Agriculture is particularly affected by the floods in an area that was already struggling with a locust outbreak in the last months. Over 3,900 ha of rice fields have been submerged. In the medium term, there are concerns over the food security situation. An in-depth assessment by food partners is being planned.  The child protection network in Mahajanga deployed social workers to monitor temporary sites. So far no cases violence or exploitation have been reported and no children were separated from their parents. Information on the districts of Soalala, Mitsinjo and Besalampy is currently being compiled following the aerial assessment. The Malagasy Red-Cross is also assessing the situation and is supporting displaced families and WASH activities. Additional pre-positioned Red Cross relief goods can be used in case needed following ongoing assessments.  As a result of funding constraints, a US$70,000 Emergency Cash Grant application has been submitted to OCHA, for logistical support to enable aerial assessments and provision of urgent relief items.  In Comoros, ongoing assessments by the General Directorate of Civil Protection (DGSC) and the Red Crescent have to date found that around 8,800 people have been affected by Tropical Cyclone Hellen.  In Anjouan, the poorest island in Comoros and the hardest hit, 7,869 people have been displaced, of which 6,142 are being hosted by relatives and 1,727 moved to 3 camps established at schools. An estimated 720 houses have been damaged and 180 houses destroyed. In Moheli, one death has been reported and 1,087 displaced people are being hosted by relatives. Three villages were flooded by storm surges and three others isolated by landslide. Electricity in some areas has still not been restored. In Grande Comores, roads have been damaged and houses flooded by a high tide. See attached map indicating impacts.  The situation is at this stage within the capacity of Government to respond. It is planning to dispatch over the next few days sufficient shelter and food supplies for those affected in Anjouan. Authorities have also started repairing roads. Other relief supplies are expected to be dispatched soon, with the assistance of UNICEF, which has also deployed a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) specialist to assist the Red Crescent in the management of the camps in Anjouan.  In Mozambique, according to the UN Resident Coordinator's Office, the heavy rains brought on by the system that eventually became Tropical Cyclone Hellen late last week affected an estimated 1,929 households (9,645 people) in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. The affected districts are Quissanga, Balama, Montepuez, Metuge, Ibo, Mecufi, Mocimba de Praia, Nangada and Muidumbe; seven of which are inaccessible by road from Pemba (the provincial capital, which is also affected). Any humanitarian support will therefore have to be by sea or air.  Most affected households are staying with host families. Some accommodation centers have been opened in Pemba for extremely vulnerable families. The Government would prefer affected families to remain with host families as much as possible. The National Institute of Disaster Management (INGC) is requesting the following humanitarian support via existing Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) structures:  400 tents for immediate shelter for families whose houses were completely destroyed;  100 tons of food to cover the food needs of those affected for a period of 1 month, including host families;  INGC is working to establish relocation communities to encourage people to leave the flood plains, for which it is requesting 600 shelter kits for families to start construction once an area has been identified in next couple days.  INGC will send a Mozambique Air Force plane to Pemba tomorrow to take three tons of food to cover immediate needs. WFP will mobilize trucks from Beira on 02 April with 160 tons of food and shelter kits from the NGO consortium COSACA. A full assessment will be carried out in the upcoming days, which will be joined by HCT partners. Authorities will be preparing damaged roads and bridges. The situation is under control and a plan is underway to support affected families.  The CCGC (Coordinating Council for Disaster Management) will meet tomorrow to make further decisions on the current situation and response in Cabo Delgado. The meeting will also consider the possibility of the Ex-Hellen weather system making landfall over Mozambique on 05 April, potentially affecting the provinces of Sofala and Nampula.\n",

The Disaster Management Information System (DMIS) is a web-based working tool made accessible only to Red Cross and Red Crescent staff working in National Societies, delegations and Geneva headquarters. It is a system from which users will be able to access: real time information on disaster trends  online internal and external resources  tools and databases  The DMIS project started in February 2001 as a follow up to Strategy 2010 and in response to the need for informed decisions, speed and efficient operational readiness. DMIS is the result of a major effort made by the Federation in addressing the complexity of information exchange in the humanitarian community and to support an efficient disaster preparedness and response for the whole Federation's Red Cross and Crescent network at a global level.

      "Costa Rica saw further heavy rainfall and flooding on Monday 06 July and Tuesday 07 July 2015. WMO report that Puerto Limon saw 174.9 mm of rain fall in 24 hours during that period. Costa Rica’s National Meteorological Institute have warned that the heavy rainfall will continue.  Costa Rica’s National Emergency Commission (Comisión Nacional de Prevención de Riesgos y Atención de Emergencias – CNE) issued a red alert for parts of Heredia and Limón provinces.  Authorities say that the rain and flooding has forced a total of 1057 people to evacuate thier homes and move to one of the 13 temporary shelters set up by CNE, many of them in local community halls or churches. Most of those displaced are in the canton of Sarapiqui.  As of 07 July 2015, 94 communities across 15 cantons were facing access problems after roads had been flooded or damaged.  2 Weeks of Flooding  This latest period of heavy rain means that parts of Costa Rica have suffered flooding for over 2 weeks. Floods in the Caribbean and Northern regions on 21 June 2015 left 25 communities isolated and hundreds displaced.  After a short respite, where some of those affected were able to return to thier homes, northern and eastern parts of the country were faced with further torrential rain on 27 June which caused damage to roads, bridges and houses, and affected over 200 communities across 3 provinces of Limón, Heredia and Cartago.  Colombia and Venezuela  The heavy rain is continuing to fall in parts of northern Colombia and Venzuela, both of which have been hit by floods over the last 10 days. Over 50 mm of rain fell in 24 hours between 06 and 07 July in Arauca, Colombia, according to WMO. Guanare in Venezuela saw 53 mm of rain in the same period. A state of emergency was recently declared after heavy rain and floods in the state of Apure, Venezuela.\n",

      "Over 2,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes in Baracoa, in Guantánamo Province, Cuba, after a storm and severe flooding damaged 100s of homes in the areas, according to Cuba’s State News Agency, Granma.  This is the second major flood event to hit Cuba in the last few days. Wide areas of the capital city of Havana were flooded on 30 April after 188 mm of rain fell in 24 hours. At least 2 people died and several buildings collapsed. Havana has not been affected by the heavy rain this time around.  Granma say that 350.7 mm of rain fell in Baracoa from 02 to 03 May 2015.  The rain forced rivers to burst their banks and resulting floods damaged homes, roads and crops. The areas of La Granjita and Horno de Cal were said to be the worst hit. Over 250 homes were damaged either by flooding or strong winds. At least 4 homes were completely destroyed. Some of those displaced have since started to return to their homes  More Severe Weather Expected  El Instituto de Meteorología de Cuba (Insmet) yesterday forecast more severe weather, including heavy rain, over the next few days.  Over the last 24 hours, Puerto Padre, Las Tunas, also on Cuba’s northern coast, saw 85 mm of rain. On the south coast, Santa Cruz Del Sur, Camaguey, saw 53.8 mm of rain.\n",

      "IDMC bases its estimates on the Republic of Congo’s own government estimate, which was published in its Displaced Populations Report of March 2009. This is the latest source available  Up to 800,000 people in the Republic of the Congo – a quarter of the country’s population – were internally displaced during the 1990s by armed conflict in the Pool region between government forces and rebels originating from among the Lari ethnic group. The conflict ended in 2003, and by 2006, according to a government estimate, only 7,800 people remained displaced in Pool.  The figure’s most important limitation is that no new assessment of the number of IDPs has been conducted since 2009. Therefore, it is not known if IDPs have achieved durable solutions, leaving unanswered the question of whether internal displacement has really ended in the Republic of Congo.  The above figures do not include people displaced by slow-onset and sudden-onset natural hazards. In November 2012, for example, floods displaced an unknown number of people in Pointe-Noire, along Congo’s coast, and it is not known how many of those displaced have been able to return to their homes  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it.\n",

      "Vodeni val je prošao Karlovac, vodostaji rijeka Kupe i Korane napokon su se spustili ispod osam metara, što je za više od pola metra niže no što su bili jučer kada je vladao potpuni kaos.  \"On je već deset godina gradonačelnik i s gradskim je čelništvom već mogao djelatno pokazati volju da se rješava problem poplava, a ne samo da čeka pomoć države. Grad je već mogao obaviti nužne pripreme, izdati suglasnosti, dozvole i druge dokumente za projekt vodozaštite\", izjavio je ministar Jakovina..  \"Ispričavam se svim stradalima zbog poplava na karlovačkom području zbog krivih prognoza. Svi su podaci upućivali na niži vodostaj, ali i to nam ukazuje na neumoljivost i nepredvidivost prirode. Na nebranjenim su području pričinjene velike štete i zbog toga mi je veoma žao. I ovaj nam slučaj govori da moramo intenzivno nastaviti sustavnu obranu od poplava u koju smo uložili 350 milijuna kuna. Za taj smo projekt planirali i novac iz kohezijskog fonda EU. U narednih sedam godina za te potrebe očekujemo pomoć od 250 milijuna eura\", rekao je Jakovina.  Kupa je na sisačkom području u stalnoim laganom porastu, najviši i rekordni vodeni val, koji dolazi iz Karlovca, očekuje se u nedjelju, a već je pod vodom stotinjak vikendica na području Letovanića. U Farkašiću je oko podneva vodostaj iznosio 960 centimetara, pa je na tom području proglašeno izvanredno stanje obrane od poplava. Stručnjaci predviđaju da bi za 24 sata vodostaj mogao narasti i do rekordnih tisuću centimetara. Vatrogasci i mještani pokupskih naselja nastavljaju podizanje zečjih nasipa na najugroženijim područjima.  \"Iako očekujemo kako će štete biti minorne, sa strepnjom očekujemo vodni val koji bi do sisačkog područja trebao stići noćas ili sutra ujutro, pa su sve službe u punoj pripravnosti\", rekao je ministar Jakovina.  U Karlovcu pod vodom 343 kuće, mještani bijesni na ministra Jakovinu  u Karlovcu je zbog poplava u petak proglašena elementarna nepogoda, a zatvorene za promet su dvije državne ceste, sedam županijskih i sedam lokalnih.  Nešto iza podneva u subotu, iz Karlovca se javio naš reporter Ivan Vrdoljak.  Ono najgore u Karlovcu je prošlo, situacija se smirila no vodostaji su i dalje vrlo visoki. U odnosu na jučerašnje maksimalne vodostaje Kupe od 855 centimetara, sada je taj vodostaj pao za gotovo pola metra. On sada iznosi od 807 do 809 centimetara za obje rijeke, Kupu i Koranu.  Prema posljednjim informacijama Državne uprave za zaštitu i spašavanje, u Karlovcu su 343 kuće pod vodom.  Sve su državne ceste na karlovačkom području zatvorene i njima se može putovati isključivo čamcima. Pohvalna je reakcija vatrogasaca, volontera i ronioca koji ovdje dežuraju 27 do 30 sati i pomažu ljudima.  Opasnost se sada iz Karlovca u kojem će se štete zbrajati tjednima seli nizvodno s Kupom.

      "  Current situation  Heavy rainfall in Eastern Croatia from 13-15 May 2014, has caused large-scale flooding with subsequent collapse of transit routes and evacuation of local population. In three days the precipitation levels have exceeded the average for three months. The floods forced the evacuation of, according to the latest data, 17,631 people. They are currently located in 6 collective centres in the adjacent region, as well as in many private homes of people who took them in. Further 36,000 people in Croatia are currently endangered by the floods. Over 17,000 school children are currently unable to attend school. There have been 2 casualties so far.  Until now, 4,367 housing units have been flooded and we anticipate that around 30% of them will need to be demolished because they will most likely have to be deemed unsuitable for habitation. Around 50% of all crops have been destroyed, and around 21,000 cattle have been evacuated from the flooded area. The most effected cities and municipalities are: Slavonski Brod, Municipality of Oriovac, Municipality of Slavonski Šamac, Municipality of Oprisavci, Municipality of Okučani and the wider area of Županja.  In the whole affected region (Croatia, B-H and Serbia), more than 100,000 homes, 230 schools, businesses, roads and railways were washed out by the flooding.  Croatia has been able to address the immediate humanitarian relief needs in the flooded areas on its territory with its own capacities. However, in order to address the needs of the affected people and areas in the short-, medium- and long term, on 23 May 2014 the Government of Croatia has sent an appeal for international humanitarian assistance.  Response  Over 4000 officials and even a larger number of volunteers have been activated directly in activities related to rescue and protection. Furthermore, the Croatian Government has approved a programme of communal public works in order to contribute to the rehabilitation from the consequences of flooding. A minimal wage shall be paid to the people currently unemployed to join the programme.  All relevant line ministries have introduced measures for immediate relief, e.g. shelter, food and care for the displaced, books for the children, chemical (disinfection) and physical (removal of carcasses) decontamination of the area, feed for the evacuated cattle etc. In a coordinated effort, the Ministry of Social Policy and Youth, with the Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Defence collected humanitarian aid from citizens and have sent in-kind assistance as well as monetary and psychosocial assistance to evacuated families.  Rapidly changing circumstances in the field, vastness of the flooded area, damage on the houses, other facilities, crops and cattle, threat of dislocated landmines and a large number of long-term displaced persons from Croatia, as well as from Bosnia and Hercegovina, along with continually arriving offers of assistance from our friends in the international community, prompted Croatia to issue a humanitarian appeal and ask for international assistance.  On 23 May 2014 Croatia has issued an international humanitarian appeal in order to effectively meet the needs of the affected population and regions. The international community has been informed about the concrete needs, most of which can in best way be covered by direct financial assistance. In general, we have been able to address the immediate humanitarian relief needs in Croatia for food, shelter and medical care, as well as provide assistance to the neighbouring countries. However, we anticipate that in the medium- and long-term there will be a gap between the immediate relief and subsequent rehabilitation, reconstruction and development.  Currently, the water level has started to recede. All available forces for protection and rescue activities continue to work on strengthening the existing and in building new dikes, sharing food and water for vulnerable populations, rescuing survivors and disposing of animal carcasses. The situation remains complex due to landslides and road damages. State and local authorities are engaged in on-going evacuation efforts.  Thorough analysis of the current situation in affected areas has already begun as well as a breakdown of necessary activities and tasks for the forthcoming period. Even though water levels have begun to recede there is a fear for new disasters since the area is contaminated with landmines and other non-exploded remnants of war. Due to the flooding the landmines may have been dislocated outside the previously marked locations, which make the subsequent assessment of the damage, clearing and the reconstruction of the flooded areas even more delicate and dangerous. The cleaning of landmines in two municipalities of Gunja and Vrbanja is estimated at the cost of 4 million euros. In order to find a regional solution for this sensitive issue Croatia is communicating with experts from Bosnia and Hercegovina and Serbia.  Furthermore, we are facing the rising threat of mosquitos in the flooded areas in all three countries. This problem will be resolved regionally with the assistance of the EU. Overall sanitary decontamination of the area is also a precondition for further steps. Another pressing issue is to provide longer-term shelter in form of air-conditioned containers for the displaced people until their homes will be dried and reconstructed.  CONCRETE NEEDS  Bearing in mind a constant change of circumstances affecting the needs-assessment, the possibility of more effective utilisation of capacities otherwise needed for coordination, transport, storage and dissemination of in-kind assistance, and the potential mobilisation of our own resources (e.g. in the field of demining), in order to adequately, effectively and sustainably respond to the catastrophe, financial assistance would be the preferred alternative of support, without prejudice to other kinds of assistance offered.  Croatian assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia  Croatia extended aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia comprising of financial means, goods and manpower. The Croatian Government has provided financial assistance in the amount of 200,000 euros, to the Bosnian and Serbian Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. We are accommodating displaced people from Bosnia and Hercegovina (currently about 500) which are crossing the border and looking for refuge in Eastern Croatia.  To Bosnia and Hercegovina we sent 2 helicopters, 9 motor boats, 15 vehicles, civil protection team, fire-fighters, divers and policemen totalling 52 people. They have evacuated and saved more than 1,000 people. 90,000 sand bags have been delivered.  To the most endangered municipalities in Serbia, we sent 4 divers and 2 policemen. After having finished the operations in Eastern Croatia, we pledged to send 2 motorboats, 5 vehicles, one civil protection unit and one firefighting team, in total 15 personnel. A water purification system has been offered.  Financial donations to citizens of the flood-hit areas of Croatia can be made in two different ways:  http://www.mvep.hr/en/info-servis/press-releases/,21638.html\n",

      "HANGZHOU/SHANGHAI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The rapid decline of the strength of Typhoon Chan-Hom has given a break to coastal regions in east China, yet local governments are on alert of secondary disasters.  Chan-Hom, the ninth typhoon this year, made landfall on Saturday at 4:40 p.m. in Zhujiajian Township in the island city of Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province.  According to the provincial meteorological station, Chan-Hom, which packed winds of up to 53 meters per second in Dinghai and 49 meters per second in Shipu, downgraded to a tropical storm at 9 a.m. Sunday and left.  Data from the provincial hydrographic office show the average amount of rainfall in Zhejiang reached 77 millimeters from Saturday to Sunday. Ningbo City registered 217 mm of rain and neighboring Yuyao City 322 mm.  No casualties have been reported. A total of 1.92 million people in nine cities have been affected, including more than 1.11 million who were evacuated.  Direct economic losses are estimated at 5.86 billion yuan (940 million U.S. dollars), according to the provincial flood control and drought prevention headquarters.  The worst hit sector is agriculture with economic losses of 3.62 billion yuan, because the typhoon coincided with the picking period of vegetables and melons and wrecked havoc on agricultural facilities, the headquarters said.  Local government warned of water-logging disasters in some cities and torrents in mountainous regions following the record rainfall brought by the typhoon.  As of early Sunday morning, the storm has passed the same latitude as Shanghai about 100 kilometers off the city's coast and moved towards northeast, the municipal meteorological observatory said.  The city government has lifted the warning as rains and winds weakened significantly on Sunday.  According to the city's flood control authority, Shanghai evacuated 163,000 people and called back 3,000 ships to harbor on Saturday, as the city experienced rainstorms of up to 114.6 mm and strong gales of over 30 meters per second.  On Saturday, the typhoon prostrated more than 3,000 trees in Shanghai and forced the city's subway to suspend service on some stretches. More than 1,000 flights have been canceled at the city's two airports.  The neighboring Jiangsu Province also ended the emergency response on Sunday noon after Chan-Hom, which forced more than 78,900 people to be evacuated and 22,423 ships recalled, failed to bring more rain or wind to the province, local flood control and drought prevention headquarters said.  However, many rivers and lakes are still running above the warning water lines, leading to high potential of floods and mudslides, the headquarters warned.\n",

      "The figure is the number of people registered as IDPs by the government of the Republic of Cyprus (GoC, 2014) and includes around 117,000 people with IDP registration who were displaced in 1974 and who are still alive.  The government of Cyprus continues to register IDPs on the basis of identity cards given to people who, at the time of the Turkish invasion:  lived in the northern part of the island, that later declared itself as the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (TRNC);  had a permanent residence in areas under the control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus because of their profession but their house and/or their property was in areas controlled by TRNC;  temporarily lived abroad due to professional obligations that arose while they resided in Cyprus.  Moreover, descendants of people with the identity card are also eligible to receive such identity cards and to be recognised as IDPs (GoC).  Displacement occurred in 1974 as groups backed by Greece’s military junta ousted the Cypriot leader, and Turkey sent troops to the island in response. As a result, Greek Cypriots fled to the south, while Turkish Cypriots fled to the north. In both cases, thousands of people were forced from their homes, suffered significant loss and needed large-scale assistance.  Turkish Cypriots live in the TRNC, only recognized by Turkey. In 1975, following the Vienna III Agreement, the TRNC declared that the internal displacement situation was over, and the residents were given the option to move with[IS1] in TRNC with assistance, or to remain where they were with protection guarantees. Since that time the “TRNC” has not granted displaced status or benefits to people displaced to TRNC (IDMC, 20 June 2009).  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it.\n",

      "Some 50 people were forced to leave their homes due to a strong fire that has broken out around 11:00 pm on Monday night on the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac, the country's national TV station reported.  Around 2 kilometers of pine woods are burning and the flames have reached the houses of the town of Trstenik around 3:00 am on Tuesday morning despite the efforts taken by the fire brigades. Almost all the residents of the entire town were evacuated, the news portal Index.hr reads.  The situation is dire as well in the region of Smokvica and the Korcula Peninsula, where a fire has erupted over the weekend. After it was localized on the peninsula's northeastern side, the flames went out of control again on Monday. However, the situation is most critical in the region of Brno where so far the fire has burnt around 500 hectares of pine woods.  Besides the fire brigades, special planes are also deployed to extinguish the fire.\n",

      "Las fuertes lluvias registradas durante el fin de semana, producto de un “disturbio tropical”, incomunicaron 23 comunidades, afectaron 606 viviendas y dejaron al menos una persona ahogada y otra desaparecida.    El director del Centro de Operaciones de Emergencias (COE), general Juan Manuel Méndez, precisó que dos puentes y un sistema eléctrico fueron afectados, así como un hospital en San Pedro de Macorís, el cual resultó anegado.    Méndez subrayó que las personas desplazadas a casas de familiares y amigos ya comenzaron a retornar a sus hogares por lo que el número bajó de 4,015 a 3,603.    Asimismo, el organismo mantiene el alerta para 18 provincias, ante posibles inundaciones y deslizamiento de tierra.    La normalidad comenzó a retornar en las provincias de Hato Mayor y San Pedro de Macorís, las cuales se encontraban en alerta roja por el paso de la depresión tropical.    En Hato Mayor las aguas provocaron daños materiales e inundaciones. Mientras que en San Pedro de Macorís, los sectores más afectados fueron Puerto Rico y Planta Bella, donde se estima que residen unas dos mil personas.    Las aguas provocaron el derrumbe del puente que comunica a esos sectores, mientras que sus habitantes sacaban agua de sus casas, fruto de las lluvias registrada en horas de la madrugada del pasado sábado.    Los moradores de esos barrios llamaron a las autoridades a construir un muro de contención para evitar que en tiempo de lluvias sus casas se vean afectadas nuevamente por la crecida del río Paña Paña.    “Estamos cansados de esta situación. Mira nosotros pasamos la noche sacando agua de nuestras casas; tuvimos que subir los muebles y las neveras sobre madera para que no se nos dañaran, porque el agua entró a nuestras casas”, explicó el presidente de la Junta de Vecino de Planta Bella, Juan Francisco Pacheco. Las lluvias también derribaron parte de la verja perimetral de la escuela básica Los Hatillos, obra que fue inaugurada hace 10 días.    Silvana Javier, una anciana de 70 años, dijo que a pesar de perder parte de sus ajuares que adornaban su humilde vivienda, da gracias a Dios por estar viva, ya que fue auxiliada por una buena samaritana vecina suya, que solo identificó como Fior.    El jefe de la Defensa Civil de San Pedro de Macorís, Pablo Polanco Rojas, informó que por las inundaciones, más 350 personas fueron llevadas a casas de familiares y amigos, pero que la mayoría retornaron a sus casas.    Sin embargo, unas 40 personas, incluyendo 20 niños, aún están refugiadas en una iglesia cristiana del barrio Villa Progreso II, a quienes los Comedores Económicos les están suministrando los alimentos. Además de Villa Progreso, se vieron afectados los sectores: José Francisco Peña Gómez, Los Guandules, del 24 de Abril, Villa Municipal, Pedro Justo Carrión, Los Cangrejitos y otros.    En los sectores inundados, tanto en Hato Mayor como en San Pedro de Macorís, se observó una gran cantidad de agua en las diferentes calles y callejones.    Los afectados dijeron que recibieron raciones de alimentos, colchones y mosquiteros de manos de las autoridades municipales.    Anciano murió ahogado  Un hombre identificado como Chichí Reyes, de aproximadamente 70 años, murió ahogado por el desbordamiento del arroyo Paña-Paña, en el sector Villa Ortega de Hato Mayor.    El reporte detalla que la víctima fue arrastrada por las aguas cuando intentó salir de su hogar.    El director del COE recordó que la provincia Hato Mayor está en alerta desde hace tres días y que esta situación conlleva la obligación, no solo de las autoridades, sino también de la población.    “Siempre señalamos que deben abstenerse de cruzar arroyos, ríos y cañadas que presenten grandes volúmenes de agua”, refirió  Un desaparecido  Los organismos de socorro buscaban ayer al empresario Alfonso Astacio (Manito Fonso), nativo de Hato Mayor, quien fue arrastrado por las aguas cuando, abordo de su camioneta, intentó cruzar el Río Naranjo.    El director del COE, afirmó que en ese caso no podían atribuírsela a las fuertes precipitaciones porque se debía a una “inobservancia” de la víctima al tratar de cruzar un río pese a la alerta emitida por las autoridades.    “En este caso intentaron cruzar un río en Hato Mayor en una camioneta y por eso resultó esa persona afectada. Nos unimos al dolor que embarga a esa familia, pero no va a entrar dentro de este operativo porque básicamente fue algo que fue una inobservancia de lo que establecen la ley y los reglamentos” explicó.  Se alejó del país    El disturbio tropical se alejó del país y fue localizado próximo a las Bahamas, donde se convirtió en la tormenta tropical Cristóbal, con movimiento hacia el noreste.    La Oficina Nacional de Meteorología, mantiene el aviso meteorológico contra inundaciones y deslizamientos de tierra a los residentes en zonas bajas cercanas a ríos, arroyos y cañadas en las provincias San Pedro de Macorís, La Romana,    La Altagracia, El Seibo, Hato Mayor, María Trinidad Sánchez, Santiago, Duarte, San José de Ocoa y Azua. Además, continúa con el Alerta meteorológica contra inundaciones urbanas para el gran Santo Domingo, San Pedro de Macorís y Santiago. Por otro lado, se recomienda a los operadores de las frágiles y pequeñas embarcaciones permanecer en puerto en todo el perímetro costero, debido a olas y viento anormales. l    Las lluvias mejorarán servicio de agua potable      El director de la Corporación del Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Santo Domingo dijo que las lluvias caídas este fin de semana han mejorado notablemente el servicio de agua potable en todo el Gran Santo Domingo.    Alejandro Montás señaló que el servicio será mucho mejor a partir de mañana martes ya que la producción de agua potable se colocaría en los niveles esperados para producir más de 360 millones de galones diarios para distribuirlos en el Distrito Nacional y la provincia Santo Domingo.    El funcionario dijo que las lluvias han mejorado los sistemas Valdesia, Haina-Manoguayabo, Isa-Mana, Duey, Isabela y Barrera de Salinidad.    Montás precisó que la Presa Jigüey se encontraba en la cota 504.44 y la de Valdesia en 135.65, lo que significa que en las últimas 24 horas Jigüey ha incrementado su nivel en 86 centímetros y Valdesia en 63 centímetros.      Disminuirán lluvias  Para este lunes se prevé una disminución gradual de las precipitaciones a medida que se aleje la nubosidad asociada a la tormenta tropical”.    MOPC evalúa daños provocaron lluvias      El Ministerio de Obras Públicas y Comunicaciones (MOPC) informó ayer que evalúa los daños en estructuras viales en la región Este, provocados por los fuertes aguaceros registrados en los últimos tres días a consecuencia del disturbio tropical que afectó a Puerto Rico y el país.    Funcionarios del MOPC, el director del COE, y el director de la Comisión Militar y Policial de Obras Públicas, general Estanislao Gonell Regalado, en compañía de autoridades provinciales y municipales, supervisaron la región Este para percatarse de los daños causados por el fenómeno atmosférico, evaluarlos y luego proceder a repararlos.    Ramón Pepín, director general asistente del MOPC, dijo que el ministro Gonzalo Castillo, por instrucciones del presidente Danilo Medina, envió la comisión de funcionarios a las provincias San Pero de Macorís, Hato Mayor y El Seibo, con fines de que inspeccionen las vías y se proceda a reparar los daños ocasionados por las lluvias a la mayor brevedad posible.  Pepín indicó que en Hato Mayor hay dos puntos críticos, uno en el puente ubicado en la calle 30 de Marzo, cuyo asfalto fue levantado por la crecida de una cañada, y otro puente que su área hidráulica fue entaponada, lo que provocó el desbordamiento de otra cañada. Asimismo, los aproches del puente-badén de la comunidad de Yerba Buena fueron erosionados por la crecida del río, mientras que en El Seibo se evaluó el puente-badén de la comunidad La Cuchilla, también afectado por la crecida del río.\n",

      "Heavy rain and floods have prompted emergency authorities in the Dominican Republic to evacuated over 15,000 people, mostly in the country’s north and eastern regions.  Over 70 mm of rain fell in 24 hours between 20 and 21 February in Savana de la Mar, a town in the Hato Mayor province of the Dominican Republic. Puerto Plata in the northern province Puerto Plata, saw 53.7 mm during the same period. The following day the Las Americas airport area close to Santo Domnigo saw 58.9mm of rain.  The worst affected districts are Puerto Plata, Espaillat and María Trinidad Sánchez, which as of yesterday were under red flood alert, while Santiago, Duarte, Sanchez Ramirez and Hermanas Mirabal were on yellow flood alert.  The heavy rain caused rivers to overflow. Damage has been reported to crops and roads, as well as 1 bridge.  Emergency Operations Center (COE) said that 3,979 homes have been flooded or damaged and 20 completely destroyed. As of 23 February 2015, no injuries or fatalities have been reported.  At one point more than 20,000 people displaced. According to the latest Emergency Operations Center (COE) report of 22 February at 08:00 local time, that figure has since fallen to 15,475.  The disaster management agency also said around 30 locations or communities have been cut off by the flooding.  One person died in flooding in the Dominican republic in November 2014. Neighbouring Haiti was also badly hit by flooding during that time. As many as 8 people died in the November 2014 floods in Haiti. The country was also hit by further flooding earlier this month (February 2015).  No flooding has been reported in Haiti recently, although information regarding flooding there is often difficult to find.\n",

      "Torrential rain since Saturday 01 November 2014 led to flooding in Cibao region, northern Dominican Republic. Nearly 60 mm of rain fell in Puerto Plata during 24 hours from 02 to 03 November 2014, according to WMO. Further flooding is possible and flood warnings have been issued for Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.  According to local emergency authorities, at least one person has been killed in the flooding, and around 100 homes inundated. The victim died after he was swept away by a swollen river in Santiago Rodriguez province.  In Dajabón province, the Dajabón River (also called Massacre River) has burst its banks, forcing over 100 families to evacuate after their homes were inundated. Flooding also caused damage to crops and livestock.  Haiti  The Dajabón River marks the border between the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It is likely that flooding has also affected communities on the Haitian side of the river, although there are as yet no reports to confirm this.  Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands  Neighbouring islands including Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, have been warned of possible flash floods over the next 24 hours. According to NOAA (the US Weather Agency) a weather system will mean slow moving thunderstorms in the area, capable of producing torrential rains in a short period. In addition, recent heavy rains over the past few days has resulted in saturated soils and above average streamflows. Runoff from any additional rain will result in flooding as rivers will react quickly.\n",

      "The death toll from a typhoon that struck China on the weekend has risen to 19, with four people missing, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday.  Seven people were killed in typhoon-triggered tornados in the southern province of Guangdong while seven died in landslides, Xinhua said citing the provincial civil affairs department.  Three fishermen died in boat accidents at sea while one person was found dead in the debris of a house that collapsed during the storm. Four fishermen were missing, Xinhua said.  The storm made landfall in Zhanjiang prefecture in the southwest of Guangdong province on Sunday, triggering widespread blackouts.  For most of its passage across the South China Sea after crossing the Philippines, Mujigae was a tropical storm then low-level typhoon. As it approached land, however, Mujigae intensified to a category 2 cyclone with sustained winds of 154-177 km/h on the international Saffir-Simpson wind scale, then jumped to Category 4 – with winds up to 298km/h capable of causing catastrophic damage – as it crossed land. The highest category on the scale is 5, or “super typhoon”.  Mujigae’s affects were felt over much of western and central Guangdong, hundreds of kilometres from the storm’s centre. Its outer rainbands spawned tornadoes that killed at least three people in Foshan, near Guangdong, while some of the heaviest rain fell in Hong Kong.  Winds knocked out power grids along the coast and authorities cancelled dozens of flights and suspended high-speed trains.  Guangdong’s civil affairs department estimates the province suffered 23 billion yuan (HK$28 billion) in losses from the storm, which affected 3.5 million people and damaged more than 280,000 hectares of crops.  One person was also killed by a falling tree in the neighbouring Guangxi province, Xinhua reported. Nearly 1.9 million people in Guangxi suffered losses and 417 homes were destroyed, it said.\n",

      "HANGZHOU, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from an east China landslide has risen to 21, with 16 people still missing, local authorities said Sunday.  Only one person has been rescued so far after the landslide hit a village in Zhejiang Province Friday night.  The landslide was reported at around 10:50 p.m. in Lidong Village of Yaxi Township in the outlying Liandu District of Lishui City, the city government said in a press release.  Torrents of mud and rocks buried 27 homes in the village, with 21 houses flooded.  Mao Zirong, Lishui's standing deputy mayor, said the large amount of mud has formed a small barrier lake at the site, hampering rescue efforts.  The local government has dispatched 52 teams composed of more than 620 people to investigate the site in case of any further disasters.  \"We have sent a team of 35 professional psychologists to provide psychological intervention for the family members of the victims,\" said Yang Xiuqing, head of Liandu District.  More than 2,300 rescuers, along with 7 sniffer dogs, are helping with rescue work.  Lishui has reported heavy rain over the past two days. As of 8 a.m. Friday, average precipitation had reached 36 mm. It was still raining when the landslide happened, the local weather bureau said.\n",

      "Imagen de la trayectoria que podría tomar en las próximas horas la tormenta tropical Erika, según el Centro Nacional de Huracanes de Estados Unidos. (NOAA NWS National Hurricane Center / FACEBOOK)  Imagen de la trayectoria que podría tomar en las próximas horas la tormenta tropical Erika, según el Centro Nacional de Huracanes de Estados Unidos. (NOAA NWS National Hurricane Center / FACEBOOK)  Las lluvias y fuertes vientos de la tormenta Erika provocaron el viernes inundaciones en República Dominicana, donde más de 7,300 personas fueron evacuadas luego de que el fenómeno dejara una estela de destrucción y 20 muertos en la isla de Dominica.  Sólo vimos cómo volaban Juan Manuel Méndez, director del centro de operaciones de emergencias de República Dominicana, detalló en conferencia de prensa que 823 viviendas fueron afectadas por las inundaciones en diferentes partes del país y tres quedaron completamente destruidas.  \"Sólo vimos cómo volaban\" los techos de zinc de las casas, dijo Altagracia Santana, de 27 años y madre de tres hijos, por vía telefónica a The Associated Press. Santana reside en un barrio marginal de la provincia San Cristóbal, 30 kilómetros al oeste de la capital.  Méndez indicó que, debido a las inundaciones, tres pequeñas localidades rurales de San Cristóbal estaban incomunicadas.  El centro de la tormenta ingresó la tarde del viernes a través de la provincia Barahona a la isla La Hispaniola, que comparten Haití y República Dominicana.  La mayoría de los más de 7,350 evacuados fueron ubicados en casas de familiares y amigos en zonas de menor riesgo. Méndez destacó que todo el país permanece en alerta máxima, ya que las lluvias continuarán durante el sábado.  \"El mayor peligro es la gran cantidad de lluvias\", consideró Gloria Ceballos, directora de la oficina dominicana de meteorología. Detalló que, aunque existe posibilidad de que la tormenta se degrade el sábado a depresión tropical, el campo nuboso que cubre gran parte de la isla provocará que los aguaceros se prolonguen durante el sábado y dejen lluvias acumuladas de entre cinco y 20 centímetros.  En alerta  Los organismos de socorro de República Dominicana mantenían la alerta en todo el país ante posibles inundaciones, mientras que las clases escolares fueron suspendidas y el gobierno ordenó cerrar las actividades laborales al mediodía para que la población permaneciera en su casas durante el paso del fenómeno.  Las autoridades de Haití declararon una alerta preventiva ante las inminentes lluvias La tormenta se ha desplazado durante todo el viernes al sur de la costa meridional dominicana, provocando precipitaciones y fuertes vientos en las localidades costeras, incluida la capital, donde algunos árboles, postes de energía eléctrica y anuncios publicitarios se derrumbaron sobre las avenidas sin provocar daños significativos.  A las 8 de la noche, el centro del fenómeno atmosférico se ubicaba a 45 kilómetros al sureste de la capital haitiana y avanzaba a 33 kilómetros por hora hacia el oeste.  Las autoridades de Haití declararon una alerta preventiva ante las inminentes lluvias y posibles inundaciones.  Las lluvias \"serán un paliativo de la sequía que ha afectado al país, pero no va a ser una solución definitiva\", consideró Ceballos, de la oficina de meteorología dominicana, al recordar que el fenómeno El Niño ha provocado la sequía más severa que vive la isla en los últimas dos décadas.  Las aerolíneas Cubana de Aviación y Spirit cancelaron los vuelos que tenían previstos para el viernes desde el aeropuerto de Santo Domingo.  Rescatistas de la isla de Dominica, en el este del Caribe, continuaban el viernes la búsqueda de personas heridas y de desaparecidos durante el paso de la tormenta el jueves, que dejó al menos 20 muertos, lluvias de hasta 38 centímetros, desbordamiento de ríos, deslizamientos de tierra y el colapso de algunos puentes.  \"Me preparaba para ir a trabajar cuando de pronto escuché un fuerte ruido y vi el lugar lleno de agua\", djio Shanie James, una madre de 30 años y empleada de una panadería. \"Tuvimos que correr para sobrevivir\".  La cuenta de muertos se incrementará  Los deslizamientos de tierra destruyeron decenas de viviendas en Dominica, como la casa de Peter Julian, un agente de seguridad de 46 años.  Tomará un par de días recuperar los cuerpos \"Cuando regresé, vi que mi casa donde he vivido por 20 años había desaparecido\", afirmó.  Roosevelt Skerrit, primer ministro de Dominica, dijo el viernes que hay 20 muertos y que la isla sufrió un retroceso de 20 años debido a los destrozos provocados por la tormenta. También exhortó a la población a que ayude a limpiar las calles donde cayeron árboles y lodo.  Un hombre y dos niños murieron cuando el lodo penetró en su vivienda en el sureste de Dominica, mientras que el cuerpo de otro hombre fue hallado en su casa afectada por un deslizamiento de tierra, dijo el jefe de la policía Daniel Carbon.  La cuenta total de víctimas mortales en Dominica se incrementará, insistió Carbon, pero advirtió que \"tomará un par de días recuperar los cuerpos\".  Claude Weekes, asistente del superintendente de la policía, indicó que las autoridades aún no han podido llegar a las zonas montañosas debido a los daños en vías y puentes. \"Ha sido realmente devastador\", consideró el oficial.  En Puerto Rico, las lluvias afectaron principalmente el sur de la isla y provocaron apagones que afectaron a unas 200,000 personas.\n",

Il s’agit notamment des localités de Rueni, Maona, Nyamubingwa et Kyabondo, situées au bord du lac Kivu.  Le chef de ce groupement, François Muharuro Wetemwami, a livré cette information, mercredi dans la matinée, après une ronde dans toutes ces localités touchées par les eaux de pluie.  Il a indiqué que les élèves ne vont plus à l’école et toutes les activités commerciales et champêtres sont paralysées, après la destruction de plus de 25 hectares de champs.  François Muharuro Wetemwami parle de plus de 400 maisons emportées par les eaux de pluies dans ces cinq villages ainsi que de la destruction de plus de 20 bornes fontaines.  Le chef du groupement Mupfunyi-Shanga indique également que des sinistrés sont, depuis quelques jours, sans nourriture.  Selon Patient Mayele Nyamwaka, représentant des enseignants de ce groupement, quatre écoles (deux primaires et deux secondaires) sont complètement détruites par ces eaux des pluies. Les élèves sont ainsi contraints de rester à la maison.  Ils passent leurs journées dans la boue dans l’espoir de récupérer quelques habits dans ce qui reste de leurs maisons détruites par les eaux de pluie. Leurs parents clament déjà leur incapacité à réhabiliter ces maisons.  Une autre pluie du samedi 4 octobre avait provoqué la mort de trois personnes. Huit personnes avait été blessées grièvement dans le groupement voisin de Bweremana, en territoire de Masisi, à 50 km à l’Ouest de Goma (Nord-Kivu).\n",

Conséquences: plus de deux mille ménages du quartier Kisanga wa Bioni ont fui les inondations vers des familles d’accueil. D’autres victimes par contre, érigent des constructions temporaires. Le chef de la cité de Bukama se plaint du manque de moyen pour la prise en charge des sinistrés.  Environ dix mille personnes sont en situation difficile dans le quartier Kisanga wa Bioni à Bukama. Certaines personnes d’entre elles s’abritent sous des manguiers.  D’autres aménagent des taudis à quelques mètres de leurs résidences. Une troisième catégorie des sinistrés est refugiée dans les familles d’accueilles.

D’après le président de la société civile de Bukama, Mathieu Lunda Ngandu, aucune assistance n’est encore fournie à ces personnes en difficulté. Il déplore cette absence de prise en charge des sinistrés.  De son côté, le chef de la cité de Bukama, Mande Katokane, parle d’une situation imprévue.

Le chef de cité croit à un retour à la normal dans les quarante huit heures, se fondant sur l’observation faite ce matinpar ses services, qui atteste une relative baisse du niveau des eaux.

Le quartier le plus touché est celui de Kamkolobondo, qui enregistre une centaine de maisons écroulées. Viennent ensuite les quartiers construits sur la baie du lac Tanganyika et le littoral de la rivière Lukuga. La Croix-Rouge locale redoute les épidémies.  La rivière Kalemie a débordé dimanche à la suite de la pluie diluvienne s’est abattue depuis 03 heures du matin, entrainant des inondations dans la partie sud-est de la ville de Kalemie. Le quartier Kamkolobondo et une partie des installations de la Société nationale des chemins de fer (SNCC) abritant différents bureaux de l’Etat et le service maritime sont touchés.  Ce quartier compte une centaine des maisons d’habitations inondées, dont une église de la 30e Communauté pentecôtiste du Congo (CPCO) écroulée. Le bilan provisoire avancé par des responsables locaux fait aussi état des dizaines d’autres infrastructures inondées au quartier Maluku non loin du Camp Police.  «Ici, c’est encore mieux! Mais, je vous dis qu’au Camp de la Gendarmerie, c’est plus grave qu’ici. Certaines maisons qui se sont écroulées et le pont même était [inondé]. Il y a un groupe de gens qui ont commencé à prier ; ils se sont enfermés dans l’église. Je ne sais pas leur sort actuellement», a témoigné un habitant du quartier Maluku.  L’écroulement des maisons, construites en majorité en briques adobes, pousse plusieurs habitants de Kamkolobondo à un déménagement forcé.  «Toutes les maisons sont en train de s’écrouler. Nous, nous quittons. Nous allons vivre chez l’oncle paternel», a affirmé Louise, 22 ans.

En tout cas, nous redoutons l’épidémie de cholera pour le moment.»  Suite à ce drame, Jean-Félix Ilunga Mpafu a appelé les habitants de Kalemie au respect des règles de construction:  «Je voudrais que notre population [et] nous tous agents de l’Etat nous puissions comprendre que nous avons l’obligation de développer notre ville de Kalemie. Pour construire, il ne faut pas qu’on commence à détruire ce qui est déjà construit.»  C’est pour la deuxième fois qu’une calamité de cette ampleur s’abat sur Kamkolobondo, En 1996, des pluies diluviennes similaires avaient fait des centaines d’autres sinistrés.

      "Floods in several areas of Democratic Republic of Congo, including the capital Kinshasa, have left at least 20 people dead since late November.  Kinshasa  BBC and Reuters are both reporting that severe flooding in the Democratic Republic of Congo capital has left dozens dead since late November.  Emmanuel Akweti, the local minister for the capital’s inner city, told the BBC that around 20 people have died since 29 November.  Reuters report that at least 31 people have died in Democratic Republic of Congo’s capital Kinshasa in the last three weeks in the worst flooding in years, the provincial interior minister said on Tuesday, warning conditions could get even worse.  Many of the deaths have occurred in communities living along or close the Congo River and its tributary, the Ndjili.  Local media, including Radio Okapi, have reported that the flooding worsened after a weekend of heavy rain which prompted rivers to overflow. Many have been forced from their homes. Those displaced are currently living along roadsides in the city, or have found refuge in churches, schools or other public buildings.  The floods have left many without drinking water after the Regideso water treatment plant was affected. Regideso said that the shortage of drinking water will affect 17 districts of eastern and central Kinshasa.  The rain is still falling and the flood situation could worsen. WMO report that 72 mm of rain was recorded in Kinshasa in a 24 hour period between 08 and 09 December 2015.  Équateur province  The station reports that thousands have been left homeless after the River Congo overflowed in parts of Équateur province. Bumba in Mongala District is thought to have been one of the worst hit areas, where local Red Cross officials say almost 400 houses have been destroyed. Floods have blocked importation supply routes in particular in south east parts of Équateur province. Radio Okapi say that, according to their sources, these floods are the strongest seen in the Central Basin since 1997.  Bas-Congo Province  Radio Okapi also report that a young child was killed and around 75 left homeless when flooding caused severe damage to houses in Lufu-Toto, Bas-Congo Province. Roads and bridges have also been damaged by floods in the province.  Rainfall  Comprehensive rainfall records for the country are unavailable.  Emmanuel Akweti told Reuters that precipitation levels this rainy season (October to April) were unusually high, with Kinshasa registering 450 mm (18 inches) of rainfall, or nearly a third of its annual average, between 17 November to 06 December alone.  The BBC says that satellite images from the area suggest that as much a month’s worth of rain may have fallen in the past week.

      "Floods have made 20,000 families homeless and inundated the main water collection station, preventing access to drinkable water  KINSHASA, Dec 8 (Reuters) - At least 31 people have died in Democratic Republic of Congo's capital Kinshasa in the last three weeks in the worst flooding in years, the provincial interior minister said on Tuesday, warning conditions could get even worse.  The deaths since Nov. 17, concentrated in neighbourhoods along the Congo River and its tributary, the Ndjili, have resulted mainly from home collapses, Emmanuel Akweti said.  The flooding has made 20,000 families homeless and inundated the main water collection station, preventing two-thirds of Kinshasa's communes from accessing drinkable water, he added.  An employee at the public water utility said officials hoped to resume service there by Thursday.  Kinshasa, a sprawling city of more than 10 million people, has notoriously poor infrastructure, with improvised wooden shacks lining the waterfront and dirt roads that often flood with the first rainfall.  Akweti said that precipitation levels this rainy season - which runs from October to April - were unusually high with Kinshasa registering 450 millimetres (18 inches) of rainfall, or nearly a third of its annual average, between Nov. 17 and Dec. 6 alone.  He warned that weather forecasters were predicting above average rainfall through to February and urged all residents living in riverside areas to evacuate.  Congo's government has invested considerably in Kinshasa's infrastructure in recent years, but critics complain that the upgrades have almost exclusively targeted the city's upscale neighbourhoods and prominent landmarks.

      "KUNMING - Twenty people were injured after an earthquake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale jolted Yongshan County in southwest China's Yunnan Province at 6:07 a.m. on Sunday, local authorities said.  Nine of them were slightly injured. Of the 11 who had been sent to county hospitals for medical treatment, five had been discharged, according to a latest statement of the county government.  The epicenter was in Wuji Township, 21 kilometers from the county seat. The source of the quake was 7 km deep.  The quake was strongly felt in the neighboring counties of Suijiang, Daguan and Zhenxiong as well as the Zhaoyang District of Zhaotong City, which administers Yongshan, according to the provincial seismological bureau.  And 1,463 houses were damaged as of 5:30 p.m., with 45 houses collapsed and 575 badly damaged. Cracks have been spotted in adobe houses and more than 76 cattle lots collapsed,said the statement.  The facilities of 14 schools were damaged, it said.  Diaster investigators have also found 70 km of roads,11 transformers, 32 water utilities, 59 km of canals and 135 km of drinking water pipeline damaged. They spotted 542 highway landslides and the facilities of 14 schools were ravaged by different degrees.  More than 1,000 local officials, policemen and militia personnel have joined rescue efforts and disaster investigations in the affected regions.  About 200 firefighters from various cities have arrived in Yongshan for rescue.  Relief materails including tents, quilts, coats, rice, edible oil, instant noodles and biscuits have beeen supplied to the victims.  Some 647 people have been safely evacuated while 721 households have regained access to electricity, said the statement.  Yunnan governor Li Jiheng led a work team to Yongshan from Ludian, also a county in Zhaotong City, where a 6.5-magnitude earthquake on Aug. 3 killed more than 600 people and destroyed 80,000 homes.  The Yongshan earthquake is not an aftershock of the Ludian earthquake as the epicenters of the two quakes are 113 km away from each other, said Zhang Junwei, an official with the provincial seismological bureau.\n",

      "By THE CAIRO POST  CAIRO: Heavy rain for two consecutive days in Egypt caused strong floods and damage in different governorates In Egypt. The rains on Sunday and Monday flooded 35 acres of agricultural land in 15 different village in Asyut and displaced hundreds of citizens since the floods destroyed the dams previously built by the army forces in Wady Al-Sheikh.  Secretary of education Directorate of Asyut said that 99 schools were suspended, which left 28,000 students at their homes in the governorate, because of the floods.  Asyut governor General Ibrahim Hammad visited the affected areas to make sure that there are no human losses. He will coordinate with Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab, promising to compensate the affected houses and agricultural lands.  There was an accident in Asyut on Thursday night when two vehicles collided due to the remnant water, mud puddles, and high speed. Twenty passengers died and two were injured on the Cairo – Asyut desert road.  “There will be appropriate will to those affected by the floods,” Hammad said on Monday evening during his phone interview on CBC Extra channel.  Hamad said the damages are yet to be determined, stressing that many areas in Asyut are now suffering due to the floods, especially in the Wady Al-Sheikh district.  No causalities were reported up until now and government will compensate people who lost their houses or lands, Hamad emphasized.  In Luxor, 147 houses were affected by the floods, most of them with cracks in the ceiling, according to Governor of Luxor Alaa Al-Harass. Some civil societies managed to provide immediate aid for those affected by the floods, mostly with rations and blankets.  Governor of North Sinai Khaled Fouda said the international road was opened again on Monday after suspension due to the floods since rocks and sand were falling on it because of the rains. Youm7 reported the collapse of four houses and some sidelines in the governorate.  In Sohag , Youm7 reported that small dams collapsed in 1994, which were built only with rocks with no cement. They violate the technical standards, which is why they were not able to resist the floods which affected agricultural lands and homes in the governorate.  Governor of Sohag Mahmoud Ateeq said that floods caused three cuts in the Sohag – Red Sea bridge as a result of torrential rain and the rush of severe floods, adding that the road gates are closed until they are completely repaired.  In the Red Sea governorate, roads were flooded and vehicles traffic was suspended in the road from Raas Ghareb to Hurghada for 15 kilometers. Hurghada International Airport witnessed a crisis when an electricity blackout due to leaked water from the ceiling.  Nine were killed and 35 injured in a bus accident in Hurghada on Saturday due to the bad weather.  Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab held a meeting with the Ministers of Housing, of Transport, and both Cairo and Giza governors to discuss the current situation and how to deal with the floods.  Mahlab assigned the Arab contractors company to find engineering solutions to prevent the accumulation of rain water in tunnels in priority areas, which causes traffic congestion.  Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Mohamed Abdul Muttalib ended his visit to Uganda prematurely after one. He came back to Egypt to follow up on the situation in the affected governorates.  Generally all governorates were assigned companies and governmental vehicles to clear water floods so the traffics could return to normal again.\n",

      "A Human Rights Watch review of media reports and official statements since 2012 showed that Egyptian officials repeatedly gave contradictory information about the smuggling tunnels between Gaza and the Sinai that they used to justify the evictions. Officials repeatedly gave widely different figures for the number of functioning tunnels and later downplayed the size of the buffer zone that they said would be razed to purportedly destroy those tunnels.  On October 29, 2014, five days after Ansar Beit al-Maqdis attacked the Karam al-Qawadis checkpoint near Rafah, Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb issued a decree ordering the “eviction and isolation” of a buffer zone extending between five and seven kilometers from the border with Gaza and including all of Rafah. Prime Minister Mehleb’s decree encompassed a much larger area than government officials had previously described in public statements about home demolitions, which the military had been conducting throughout 2013 and 2014. A map contained in the decree delineated a zone that extended along the entire 13-kilometer border with Gaza and encompassed roughly 79 square kilometers of Egyptian territory. The decree ordered that those forced to leave be provided with “due compensation” and alternative housing.  Though home demolitions dramatically accelerated after Mehleb’s decree, Human Rights Watch’s analysis of over 50 satellite images taken of Rafah between March 11, 2013, and August 15, 2015, showed that the government demolition campaign actually began sometime between late July and the end of August 2013, shortly after Morsy’s ouster and amid the intensification of attacks by armed groups.  The military demolished at least 540 buildings between Morsy’s removal and the October 24, 2014, attack that precipitated Mehleb’s decree, according to Human Rights Watch’s analysis of the satellite imagery. Most of these buildings lay within 500 meters of the border but some lay beyond a kilometer from the border. Between October 25, 2014, and August 15, 2015, satellite imagery analysis showed that the authorities demolished at least 2,715 additional buildings.  In total, the military has destroyed at least 3,255 residential, commercial and community buildings, including schools, mosques and hospitals. All of the destroyed buildings showed clear signs of having been deliberately demolished using a combination of heavy machinery and the uncontrolled detonation of high explosives.  Satellite imagery also revealed the positioning of heavy, earth-moving equipment including bulldozers, excavators and other machinery by the Egyptian military in existing bases and security posts in Rafah starting in 2013 and increasing in deployment throughout 2014. On at least one occasion in the first week of November 2014, the Egyptian army was filmed using two US-made M60 main battle tanks to fire at a building in Rafah, apparently to demolish it. Tank tracks are visible in the satellite imagery from the same area in the same period.  The start of demolitions began in July 2013, but journalists only began reporting on demolitions that September, describing them as the possible beginning of a buffer zone. Egyptian officials quoted in these media reports claimed that the buffer zone would protect Egypt’s national security by preventing Gaza-based armed groups from smuggling fighters and weapons into the Sinai and fueling the insurgency there, despite numerous reports in the media that the majority of heavy weapons smuggled into the Sinai came from Libya and not from Gaza.  On September 1, 2013, the Associated Press, citing security officials and residents, reported that the military had “bulldozed” 13 homes along the border and caved in tunnels beneath them “as prelude to the possible creation of a buffer zone to reduce weapon smuggling and illegal terrorist crossings.” The agency reported that the military “envisioned” a 500-meter-wide “building-free zone with no trees.” Though the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Occupied Palestinian Territory had reported less than two months earlier that only 10 tunnels were functioning, the Egyptian military said that it had closed “350 tunnels, or 80 about percent of the total,” since Morsy’s ouster.  Human Rights Watch satellite imagery analysis indicated that between late July and early October 2013, building demolitions in Rafah were limited to a narrow zone generally within 500 meters of the border with Gaza, and that the military destroyed an average of almost 39 buildings per month.  The military also razed at least 150 hectares of cultivated farmland along the border between July and early October 2013. Satellite imagery recorded during this period showed multiple bulldozers deployed at military posts along the border and the clearing of olive groves and other cultivated fields. Extensive bulldozer tracks are visible over the affected plots of land.  On September 15, 2013, military spokesman Ahmed Ali told a news conference that the army was clearing “buildings deemed a security threat” up to one kilometer from the border, doubling the previously reported area. But he denied that the army was establishing a buffer zone. Claiming that Gaza-based groups were mounting joint attacks on Egyptian security forces with Sinai-based groups, Ali said that houses concealing tunnels used for weapons smuggling were a threat to national security. Ali claimed that the army had destroyed 152 tunnels since June 30, the day mass protests broke out against Morsy. This was a far smaller number than the military had given the Associated Press earlier that month.  \"There is cooperation between the [Sinai] armed terror groups with their counterparts in the Gaza Strip, and more than one joint operation has been monitored,\" Ali claimed.  Though he did not present proof of such coordination, Israeli and Egyptian security sources had previously alleged connections between Ansar Beit al-Maqdis and militant groups in Gaza. When a 28-year-old man and alleged member of the Gaza-based Popular Resistance Committees was wounded in an Israeli air strike in February 2014, Israel’s General Security Agency, or Shabak, claimed that he had also smuggled arms to Ansar Beit al-Maqdis. Other analysts have pointed to statements sympathetic to Ansar Beit al-Maqdis issued by Gaza-based groups, such as the Mujahideen Shura Council, as evidence of collaboration.  On September 8, 2013, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri told the Washington Post that “there are no tunnels, none, in operation at the current time,” and added that this had never happened before. Nevertheless, in October 2013, Maj. Gen. Ahmed Ibrahim, the commander of Egypt’s border guard, claimed that security forces had destroyed 794 tunnels in 2013, a dramatically higher number than military sources had stated in September. Gen. Ibrahim added that the army planned “to create a ‘safe zone’ in Rafah through which the Egyptian border guard will be able to effectively monitor and secure border areas.”  Human Rights Watch’s analysis of satellite imagery showed that during the following five months, between early October 2013 and late February 2014, the overall number and rate of building demolition substantially increased to an average of almost 60 buildings per month. The zone for demolition also increased substantially, including buildings far beyond the initial border area almost one kilometer from Gaza.  Still, in February 2014, an Egyptian security source told the Ma’an News Agency that the military had destroyed only 10 tunnels and eight houses as part of a campaign to establish a buffer zone that would only extend 300 meters in populated areas and 500 meters in “open areas.”  Between March and April 2014, satellite imagery revealed a moderate drop in the demolition rate to 34 buildings per month. This was followed by an apparent cessation in demolition activities during a three-month period between May 2 and August 1, during which the average demolition rate fell to only 1.5 buildings per month. While the Egyptian authorities did not issue any statement regarding this decline, it is possible that this pause was in part due to the onset of Ramadan on June 29, 2014, and the start of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, dubbed Operation Protective Edge by Israel, on July 8, 2014.  In August 2014, “informed sources” in the government told the Al Monitor news website that the army planned to spend two years “razing” homes in a buffer zone up to one kilometer from the Gaza border.  Human Rights Watch’s analysis of satellite imagery recorded between August 1 and October 25, 2014, showed that government forces not only resumed their demolition activities during this period but geographically expanded then into new areas in Rafah, targeting 80 buildings as far as 1.4 kilometers from the border. All of these demolitions occurred before Prime Minister Mehleb issued the decree establishing the buffer zone and ordering its eviction.  On October 29, 2014, the same day that Mehleb issued the decree ordering the “isolation and evacuation” of an area encompassing some 79 square kilometers of land in and around Rafah, Maj. Gen. Abd al-Fattah Harhour, the North Sinai governor, still claimed that the buffer zone would extend only 500 meters from the border and encompass just 802 homes. Despite the fact that the military had already demolished hundreds of homes between July 2013 and October 2014, Harhour claimed on the day of the buffer zone decree that only 122 homes had been destroyed. On November 17, a little more than two weeks later, the army announced in a statement published in al-Ahram newspaper that it would extend the buffer zone to one kilometer, dubbing the new extension “the second stage.”  According to media reports and a family who spoke with Human Rights Watch, the government conducted a poll in late 2014 asking residents if they preferred to receive money, land or a new apartment in compensation for their demolished homes and land. The government employees did not explain the purpose of the poll, which residents filled in at the city council office, and never made the results public, residents told Human Rights Watch.  Yehia, a farmer who lived in a one-story house located in an area called al-Nahda, 900 meters from the border, said that a committee of soldiers and government employees visited his area in early December 2014. They were filling a list of people’s names, houses, and house sizes but refused to give him any information.  Yehia went to the city council to ask about what was happening and was given the form to fill. Yehia said that the council employee did not know where the proposed land or apartment would be located or how big they would be, so Yehia chose to be compensated with money.  Yehia said he never received any official notice of the eviction. He described how he was confused and hesitant about whether to evacuate based on television statements he had seen saying that their area would be evicted:  We started evacuating the house on about December 28 and there were many rumors that the government gave up its plans to evict us … but I told my wife, let’s move our stuff early enough in order not to suffer … It took us a week to move our stuff … Three weeks later and still no one came [to ask us to leave]. I was concerned that the governor’s statement wasn’t real … we were concerned and no one explained what we should do … When we asked the army, they said no one asked you to leave. We felt we were a toy in their hands … On March 4, the army came and said they would demolish my house and they did it.  The authorities justified the expanding size of the buffer zone by claiming that they had found tunnels of ever-greater lengths. On November 17, when the military announced that it would begin demolishing homes up to one kilometer from the border, the official MENA news agency said that it was because troops had discovered tunnels 800 to 1,000 meters long. In April 2015, Egyptian media reported that the military was “studying” another possible expansion of the buffer zone after discovering a 2.8-kilometer-long tunnel.  On January 7, Harhour gave a New Year statement that was featured on a BBC Arabic television broadcast.  “I believe [constructing the buffer zone] comprises the whole of Rafah city,” Harhour said.  A reporter clarified: “This means that Rafah city as we know it wouldn’t exist.”  “No, the new Rafah city will exist,” Harhour responded.  “New Rafah,” the reporter said.  “New Rafah will exist, God willing,” Harhour said.  On April 27, the government re-issued Prime Minister Mehleb’s buffer zone decree, and Harhour told a television interviewer that the decree was “not new,” but rather a confirmation of the former decree to evacuate the border area at an “average depth of five kilometers.”  On May 26, the armed forces’ spokesman announced that the Egyptian border guard had shut down 521 tunnel openings between October 2014 and April 2015. Nevertheless, on June 14, the Egyptian armed forces claimed that they had destroyed 1,429 smuggling tunnels since January 2014.  That month, military sources told the Ma`an News Agency that they planned to expand the zone by another 500 meters, to 1.5 kilometers. Later that month, Egyptian security sources told the Reuters news agency that they had begun work on a trench twenty meters deep and 10 meters wide that would lie two kilometers from the Gaza border and be meant to halt tunnel smuggling. On August 11, Harhour announced that the government had completed a survey of buildings in preparation for a “third stage” of evictions that would encompass 1,215 houses and 40 government facilities, adding again that a “new” Rafah would be established beyond the buffer zone.  III. Violations During Evictions and Demolitions  No Proper Consultations or Notifications  According to 11 families who spoke with Human Rights Watch, Egyptian authorities did not consult with Rafah residents before issuing the eviction decree on October 29, 2014, and did not give proper notice that residents would be forced to leave. Of 11 families interviewed, only five were warned of the impending eviction. Those families said they were warned by army patrols who told them that they had between 36 and 48 hours to leave. The authorities never handed out written notice, they said. Six other families said that they received no notice or heard about the eviction only from the news media or their neighbors. Shortly before the eviction decree was issued, current and former Egyptian security officials appeared on private television shows calling for swift action and saying that “there is no need for understanding” with North Sinai residents and that “these so-called innocent residents are the ones harboring and protecting terrorists.”  At least three eyewitnesses said that government employees accompanied by army forces visited Rafah in 2014 to register the numbers of the houses and do an initial assessment in the 500-meter zone. However, they told Human Rights Watch that the officials did not tell them of any plans for eviction during the assessment and refused to give answers when asked.  All 11 families interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that they could not object to their eviction because they believed that there was no way to do so and because the demolitions occurred in an environment of fear and intimidation fostered by the government’s counterinsurgency operations and attacks by insurgent groups. One resident said that he tried to discuss with a group of neighbors how to organize a group action against the evictions, but another person with connections to the authorities warned him that they could face arrest and be accused of being terrorists and would lose their chance to receive compensation if they did so. Two residents told Human Rights Watch that they had heard of other residents being arrested on terrorism accusations. Human Rights Watch was unable to independently confirm the arrests.  Um Mohamed, who lived with her three children in a three-story building that belonged to her husband’s family, told Human Rights Watch that she was sitting at a relative’s home almost 250 meters from the border on the afternoon of October 27, 2014, when an officer accompanied by 10 soldiers knocked on the door of a neighbor’s house.  Um Mohamed said the officer told the elderly woman who answered the door that they would blow up her house the following day. When the old woman responded that her family had been living there for their entire lives, the officer responded: “That’s it, there’s no time to talk. Move your things from this moment.”  Um Mohamed said they told the officer that there was no mobile phone coverage, which the authorities regularly disable as part of their counterinsurgency efforts, and they did not know how they would be able to tell their male relatives to come move their belongings.  “Not a problem, we’ll blow it up with whatever’s inside, you don’t have to take a thing,” he said.  The elderly woman said a prayer and responded: “You’re kicking us out of our homeland.”  “Go look for another homeland. I don’t want to hear another word. I’ll be here tomorrow to blow up the house,” the officer said.  Um Mohamed said she returned quickly to her home, around 400 meters from the border, in Rafah’s Salah al-Din neighborhood. Believing that her house too might be demolished, she started moving her possessions from her home with her husband, who tried to find vehicles to move the furniture. They spent around three days moving their possessions from the third floor to the land surrounding their home even though they never received a visit from the authorities to warn them about the eviction. Um Mohamed said she began having doubts about whether the army would actually demolish their house. Her husband said they could stay at home and keep their belongings downstairs, in case “something happened.”  A few days later, the government cut the electricity and water supply and the telephone line to the house, Um Mohamed said, and shops in the area closed. Five days later, the army came to say they would demolish her home, and two days later they did, she said.  Sameh, a young man in his twenties, lived in a two-story building in Rafah’s Nahahla neighborhood, around 480 meters from the border. Sameh told Human Rights Watch that his family began seeing their neighbors evacuating in late October but did not receive any notice of the eviction from the authorities until the beginning of November, when two armored vehicles approached four adjacent houses owned by Sameh and his relatives and ordered them to leave within 48 hours.  Yousef, a professional in his forties who lives in Rafah’s Brahma neighborhood, 350 meters from the border, told Human Rights Watch about how his family was ordered to leave. He lived in a two-story building with his wife and child and shared the building with his sister, brother and mother. He said he returned to Rafah from mainland Egypt on October 28, the day after receiving a call from his sister, who had told him that an army patrol had told the family to evacuate in 36 hours. He found the streets full of tanks, and Apache attack helicopters flew overhead:  I was still talking with my family in the house when the army came back and said they didn’t want to see us here. I said what if we don’t go and [an army officer] told me they would blow up the house with everything in it and without another warning. I told my family we’re not taking anything and we’re not leaving. My mother collapsed and since then she doesn’t talk much and is always crying.  While we were sitting in the house that same day, a bulldozer came and started destroying the outside wall of our house while army tanks and armored vehicles surrounded it. I felt extremely furious and humiliated and refused to take anything from the house and said we’re not more precious than the house where we spent all our moments. I would rather they destroy the house on top of me. My cousins came and tried to remove as much of our furniture as they could, but I kept yelling at them, ‘What’s the use of moving without a house and our memories and our homeland?’  The army did not come back to demolish Yousef’s house until early December, more than a month later. He said that army officers had asked him and the owners of nine other houses to carry out the demolitions themselves. When Yousef and the others asked why, the officers said that they suspected that there were explosives inside the houses. One of the owners rented a bulldozer and partially demolished his house. Afterward, the army said they would demolish the rest of the nine houses themselves, Yousef said.  Yousef added that army officers sometimes used trained dogs when they raided homes and that the army destroyed some houses with furniture still inside when the occupants objected to leaving. The use of force intimidated residents into obedience, Yousef said.  Mohsen, a tradesperson, told Human Rights Watch that his family, who lived in Rafah’s Helwat neighborhood, never received any written or oral notice of the eviction. Nevertheless, his family began to evacuate in late October, having heard many of their neighbors talking about the eviction decision. Mohsen said that government officials who spoke on television claimed that local leaders had agreed to the eviction on residents’ behalf. Mohsen said the claim that local residents had agreed to the eviction was false and “just some media talk.” Mohsen’s family’s house was later demolished.  Hajja Zaynab, a woman in her sixties and the mother of several sons and daughters, lived in Salah el-Din neighborhood, around 300 meters from the border, in a two-story house. She told Human Rights Watch that an army patrol came in late October to warn her family to leave. Other residents told Hajja Zaynab that Rafah tribe leaders had agreed to the eviction, but Hajja Zaynab said no one knew who the leaders were.  Hajja Zaynab described the pain of losing her house:  My mother told me: ‘[Our olive] tree is your responsibility. I fed you from it and raised you on it. Even in times of war, we lived from its oil when nobody could find food.’ Now there’s nothing I can do but hold the tree and kiss it and say, ‘Forgive me, mom, what can I do.’  …  My heart breaks at every detail in the house. Every picture frame, every stone, every piece has a history and stories. How we lived sweetly and how we struggled and built our life from nothing without even a pound from those who are coming to destroy our life.  Feda’, another woman, recounted how her family watched their house being blow up:  We were watching from our relatives’ house next door when they blew it up. The moment of the explosion, I felt my heart tear … I still dream of that sight. It was the first time in my life that I saw my husband crying … The children burst into tears when they saw their father and asked him: “Why is the army demolishing our home and making you cry, dad?” He didn’t know how to respond to them, but after some time when they’ve been playing in the street with other children, they’ve learned from each other to call the army traitors and al-Sisi a traitor.  Unfair Compensation and Coerced Concession of Property  The General Mobilization Law of 1960, which allows property expropriations “for the sake of martial efforts,” formed part of the stated legal basis of the October 2014 buffer zone decree. The law provides for the president to establish a committee that is tasked with determining compensation for property expropriated during wartime. The law states that the authorities should record the property in the owner’s presence at the time of expropriation and again when the property is returned. Decree 2152 of 1960 stated that in the Sinai, which at the time was not split into different governorates, the compensation committee would be led by the governor and include the warden of the governorate center police station, the senior governor secretariat, and two other notables appointed by the governor. The decree made the discussions of the compensation committee secret. Another decree, number 540 of 1987, amended the procedure by requiring the governor’s military advisor and an army representative to be present at the meetings.  Under the General Mobilization Law, property owners have seven days to appeal the compensation committee’s decision to another committee created by the defense minister and consisting of the president of a court, another judge, and a representative of the Supply Ministry. The law states that this committee should hear the appeal “quickly” and that its decision is final. Another article of the General Mobilization Law punishes those who refuse the expropriation with a fine and imprisonment.  According to the residents interviewed by Human Rights Watch, the government has not adequately compensated residents evicted in North Sinai for their lost property and has made the compensation contingent on residents signing a waiver stating that they voluntarily turned over their property to the army, which could prevent residents from filing legal claims in the future. Human Rights Watch was unable to obtain a copy of this waiver.  The lack of warning, the order to leave quickly and the environment of intimidation fostered by the violent North Sinai insurgency and the government’s heavy-handed response also discouraged residents from contesting their eviction and compensation.  The Rafah city council and army engineers who measured the dimensions of buildings for the purpose of determining compensation did not consult with owners, witnesses told Human Rights Watch, and owners were not allowed to object to the dimensions. According to government statements and residents, the rate of compensation was 1,300 Egyptian pounds (US $170) per square meter of the ground floor of a house and 1,200 Egyptian pounds ($157) per square meter for each additional floor. The government did not provide compensation for gardens or farmed lands, which it classified as “empty,” nor did it compensate residents for lost belongings or personal distress. All residents interviewed by Human Rights Watch who owned empty or agricultural land, even if it was farmed, said that they were not compensated for the land or crops. The government committee led by the governor set compensation amounts without public consultation, as mandated by the 1960 General Mobilization Law and subsequent decree.  No resident interviewed by Human Rights Watch appealed their compensation amount to the government’s compensation committee or knew anyone who did. In December 2014, the news website Masr al-Arabiya similarly reported that residents who had wanted to dispute their compensation were unable to meet with the compensation committee or the governor. Residents told Human Rights Watch that the government asked those who wanted to contest their compensation to appeal at the Rafah city council before the same employee who had given them their compensation check. Only one resident who spoke with Human Rights Watch attempted to contest the compensation amount at the city council. He said that the city council employee with whom he spoke discouraged him by telling him that the process was only a bureaucratic one and would change nothing.  One lawyer from an organization that works on the right to housing told Human Rights Watch that they did not offer assistance or challenge the eviction decisions in court because of the environment of intimidation. Another lawyer said that the plaintiff in such a case must be an evicted citizen, but many families said that they feared arrest or intimidation if they appealed before a court.  Nine of the 11 families who spoke with Human Rights Watch said that the compensation was inadequate to purchase new homes or land equivalent to their former property. According to these families and government statements, anyone who owned property where the army found a tunnel was not entitled to compensation. However, residents said the army did not conduct investigations regarding owners’ individual responsibility for tunnels. A Rafah homeowner and an activist told Human Rights Watch that sometimes an alleged tunnel entrance was actually a hole caused by rain, but that the army still considered the owner responsible for a tunnel.  Um Mohamed told Human Rights Watch that she was relieved that her family, unlike some others, received at least some compensation.  “The state didn’t help us with anything except for the compensation and it’s good that we got it. We were afraid because we saw a lot of people around us who didn’t get compensation under the pretext of tunnels,” she said. “The tunnels were closed more than a year ago to begin with, and it was the government that originally made people do tunnel work after they closed the border crossings in Hamas’s face during Mubarak’s time.”  Um Mohamed told Human Rights Watch that her husband had to wait a week after their home’s demolition to be seen at the city council, because the demolition hadn’t been registered yet. It took another week for her husband to acquire papers from the water, electricity and other government offices showing that his family had paid their bills, she said. After they received a check from the city council, the bank refused to pay for several days, saying they had not received orders to pay yet.  “We were so scared that they wouldn’t pay us and we would have no other alternative to survive,” Um Mohamed said.  The family owned agricultural land planted with olive trees but said they received no compensation for it. Um Mohamed’s husband’s family received about one million pounds ($131,000) in compensation, which they had to split among their extended family and use to buy or rent new accommodation in al-Arish. Um Mohamed said the compensation for her family was better than for others because her building was “old and uncomplicated” compared to homes that might be worth as much as 5,000 pounds ($655) per square meter. Still, she said, property in al-Arish was significantly more expensive than in Rafah.  Mohsen’s family received around one million pounds ($131,000). He said the amount was “OK” only because his family is comparatively small—his mother, father and two siblings with spouses and children—and their house is old and simple. Mohsen’s family was not compensated for empty land and two small rooms on the roof.  Yousef said he expected that the compensation for his family’s house would be around 800,000 pounds ($105,000), which would make it “impossible” for him and each of his siblings to buy new apartments for their families. He told Human Rights Watch that he refused to do any of the procedures needed to receive compensation because he refuses the principle of forced eviction.  “Are you going to compensate me for my house, for the actual physical, psychological or social value that we put into it? … I’m not going to do any papers. If my family wants to go, they’re free. But I’m not going to participate in this farce,” he said.  Sameh told Human Right Watch that his family received 39,000 pounds ($5,110) less than what they thought they would get. They were also not compensated for empty land they owned around their house. He said that they had to wait a few weeks after the demolition to receive their compensation, since the bank would not cash their check immediately, claiming that it did not have enough cash on hand.  Marzouk, another resident, said his family appealed their 430,000-pound ($51,000) compensation, as he believed it should have been at least 600,000 pounds ($77,000) according to the size of their home.  Before receiving their check, Marzouk and his relatives had gone to the Rafah city council to hand in their completed paperwork and ask if they could know the government’s measurements of their house as well as their legal rights. The city council employee responded “disgustedly and impolitely” that there was nothing to tell them and that “the check was coming.” When Marzouk and his relatives yelled at the employee, he threatened to call the army.  After they received their check, the family again went to the city council to appeal the amount. The city employee told them to file an appeal, but as they began the process, he said, “Nothing is coming to you … what’s blown up is blown up, where are you going to get your new measurements? They only consider the measurements taken by the committee.”  Each family in Marzouk’s extended family received 110,000 pounds ($14,400) after they split the total compensation among themselves, which Marzouk said was not enough to purchase new homes equivalent to their previous ones. He said they were not compensated for 400 meters of land farmed with olive trees. They also owned land with a small building, but the government refused to compensate them for it, saying that the building had been built too recently.  All of the residents interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that to receive compensation, they were told by Rafah council employees to sign a paper stating that they voluntarily left their homes and waived the ownership of their property, turning it over to the army. Some residents said officials warned them that they would lose the compensation money and face trouble if they did not sign the paper.  Um Mohamed said that when her husband submitted all the necessary documents, they told him to come back in two days. When he went to get the check they asked him to sign the paper first:  He signed without even reading it because he was already consumed and he knew it was out of our hands. But after a while, we knew that what he signed was like a waiver or contract that we voluntarily sold our house to the state and the army.  Similarly, Sameh said that the paper that his father signed stated that no one had forced them to leave and that they voluntarily sold their house to “the state.” A city council employee told the family that “anyone who doesn’t sign won’t get any money and they’ll call him a terrorist,” Sameh said. He added: “People were signing out of fear and no one thought of any alternative. [The city employees] told us, ‘If the media asks, tell them you’re doing this because Egypt is at risk and we’re defending her from terrorism.’”  Hajja Zaynab told Human Rights Watch that “no money can compensate us for all our memories or for one day lived on our land.” With the compensation, her family bought two pieces of land in al-Arish, some 50 kilometers west of Rafah, in what she described as a “dodgy” area in order to save money. But she said that the family had been left with little money to build a new house:  Now we feel naked, without a homeland. My younger son, who didn’t even finish his education, says he has no homeland anymore. He wants to take a boat and flee to Sweden to find a country that respects him.  Maj. Gen. Abd al-Fattah Harhour, the North Sinai governor, told the newspaper al-Shorouk on April 23, 2015, that the authorities had accepted 87 appeals from families during the first round of evictions. He provided no more details. Governor Harhour also told al-Shorouk that the government had dispersed 572 million pounds ($75 million) in compensation during the first two eviction stages. He said that the government had demolished 811 homes and handed out 275 million pounds to 711 owners during the first stage—an average of roughly $51,000 per owner—and had destroyed 1,247 homes and handed out 296 million pounds to 964 owners in the second stage, an average of around $40,000 per owner.  Lack of Temporary Housing and Inadequate Assistance  The government said that in addition to compensation for expropriation, it would give out 900 pounds ($118) per demolished building to cover temporary accommodation for a period of three months following each home demolition. This amount, equating to about $40 per month, was uniform, no matter the number of occupants of the demolished house or their needs. Each of the families interviewed by Human Rights Watch said the amount was severely inadequate. In January, Governor Harhour announced that the government would increase the amount to 1,500 pounds ($197).  None of the 11 families who spoke with Human Rights Watch said they had received temporary housing or shelter from the government, and they said the government did not provide any to other families.  Residents also told Human Rights Watch that the authorities did not always carry out demolitions quickly, leaving them living in homes that had been cleared of furniture and belongings, sometimes without water or electricity, for days or weeks.  Many residents who spoke with Human Rights Watch said that one month of rent for a small, temporary apartment in nearby al-Arish cost an average of 1,000 pounds, more than the entire amount meant to cover three months of rent for an extended family. Several families said they did not bother to spend time at government offices to receive the temporary accommodation money because it was so small.  The evictions occurred during winter, when the weather was cold and rainy, families said. Given no or very short notice, families told Human Rights Watch they suffered difficult circumstances during the transition.  The government sometimes cut water and electricity to entire neighborhoods in the first few days of the eviction, and most groceries and other facilities were forced to shut down. Residents said they believed this was intended to force them to leave. Rain ruined some appliances, which families often temporarily left in the street or their yards. The 5 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew imposed in October 2014 as part of the state of emergency required families to make all their preparations and conduct all of their moves during daytime. The army did not make exceptions to the curfew when asked to do so by some families. Al-Sisi later reduced the curfew by three hours in December 2014 and by another three hours in March 2015.  The surge in demand for transportation caused prices to rise. Some families said they had to pay as much as 1,000 pounds ($131) to transfer their belongings, whereas such a move would have cost around 300 pounds ($39) before the evictions. The cost of housing in al-Arish, the largest nearby town, also rose.  “Imagine a whole city getting evicted in just a few hours, where could you find any workers or cars [to help],” asked Abu Ismail, a man in his fifties.  Um Mohamed told Human Rights Watch that her family had to cover its electronic appliances with plastic to protect them from the rain. The cars that came from al-Arish and Sheikh Zuweid, another nearby town, did not meet the demand of evicted residents, she said.  “Our problem now is to find a suitable offer in al-Arish, because the land there is expensive. We rented a small apartment in al-Arish for 1,000 pounds ($135) until we find land to buy,” she said.  Yousef could not find a car to move his family’s furniture, so his cousins moved the furniture to relatives’ land outside the buffer zone, where much of it was broken or wrecked by rain.  Sameh told Human Rights Watch that his “mother was crying all the time for her furniture that was broken and saying, ‘This was your grandmother’s, God rest her soul,’ or, ‘This special glassware in the kitchen was the set your father gave me when we married dozens of years ago.’”  Displaced families had to arrange for their own accommodation. Many of them moved to al-Arish, while others, especially those working in farming, chose to move to the agricultural area of Salehia, in Sharqiya governorate, close to the Nile Delta, where they could rent lands to resume their farming jobs. Others moved to Cairo or the Suez Canal city of Ismailia.  Some newspapers reported a temporary concentration of displaced families in at least two sites in al-Arish where they lived in tents or hastily constructed shelters. In August, Salah al-Salam, a member of the National Council for Human Rights, requested an “urgent intervention” from the Health and Housing Ministry to assist about 1,800 families displaced by the North Sinai insurgency and living in informal settlements in and around al-Arish. Al-Salam said a council delegation saw 20 gatherings of people displaced from the border who had not received compensation. Residents reportedly launched a civil society initiative to deliver some blankets and medicine to the displaced families. The National Council for Women pledged 100,000 pounds ($12,623) to assist families living in shelters in the desert, media reported in August.  Hajja Zaynab’s family stayed with a relative in an area of Rafah that was located in the second stage of the eviction before they moved to a rented apartment in al-Arish.  “My sons rented an apartment for 1,000 [pounds] per month in al-Arish. It’s not even worth 200 pounds. It’s a very small, two-bedroom apartment, but what can we do? … The government never gave us a single pound for housing like they said,” she said.  Yousef said that the government’s money for three months of temporary accommodation was “farcical” and not enough for “even a cowshed,” and that his family did not apply for it.  Sameh said his family rented a small apartment in al-Arish for 1,200 pounds per month:  The apartment is small. It’s frustrating because eight people now have to live in a small apartment and no one has privacy … We still don’t know what to do with the money we received (around 800,000 pounds) … The average price to buy a land here (in al-Arish) is 900 pounds per meter … I was engaged and I had my own apartment ready before. Now I don’t know if I am getting married or even where to live.  Some families said that the army sometimes took between a few days and a few weeks to demolish their homes after ordering them to evacuate within 36 to 48 hours. Some residents had no place to go, while others were afraid that if they left, someone might dig a tunnel under their property, with the result that they would lose the opportunity to receive compensation.  Yousef’s family did not leave when the army did not return immediately to carry out the demolition. He told Human Rights Watch:  On the second day, the army didn’t come. We decided to stay because we didn’t know where to go. They didn’t offer us an alternative … Suddenly the water and electricity and all the services were cut and we had to stay in the house in extremely cold and rainy weather. Imagine spending the night in darkness trying to deal with it and trying to go to the bathroom with random shooting all around and the sound of dogs and your mother and sister crying and remembering the spirit of our father. We used to see how our father supervised the building of this house and worked with his own hands with the workers ... We were crying and imagining that if he were living among us and saw his house demolished unjustly he would have died in pain.  Sameh, who lived with his parents and two married siblings, said his family anxiously rushed to empty their house of furniture, but that the army did not come back for almost a month after the 48-hour notice. Rafah families often tried to take everything from their homes before the demolitions, so Sameh’s family lived without windows, doors, electricity or water after they moved their belongings. They were afraid that someone would dig a tunnel while they were gone. “Our life would be ruined as a result,” he said. That month, Sameh said, “was one of the hardest periods of our life.”  Anyone who needed to use the bathroom had to walk to a neighbor’s house 500 meters away, and no one could leave home after 5 p.m. because of the curfew. The family collected wood during the day to burn in the evening for warmth. One night, Sameh’s niece was sick, and her father wanted to get medicine from a neighbor, but the army was firing guns, and Sameh’s niece spent the night with a “very bad” fever.  Another night, Sameh said, when the weather was very windy and rainy and there were sounds of gunshots and dogs barking, they heard a sudden, violent explosion:  My younger sister and niece were so terrified they burst into tears and wet themselves out of fear … A part of our house wall fell. We thought there was an attack or a war, but we didn’t understand what happened until the next day, when we knew that they blew up a house next to us.  Hajja Zaynab said that government officials on television news broadcasts claimed to be helping Rafah residents move, but “we didn’t even see one official … we could hardly find a car to move our furniture.” Like Sameh, she said her family had to live in their house for 10 days waiting for it to be demolished.  Fatma, a schoolteacher, described her family’s last few days in Rafah:  How would you feel when you see an old man crying and kissing the walls of the house and the ground and breaking your heart while you have to help moving your stuff as soon as possible? How would you feel when you see your decade-old wedding portrait dumped on the ground and broken under the rain and sand?  Though the army had said they were going to destroy the house imminently, it was a week before they returned.  While we waited my husband slept in the house to protect it, because the army was looking for any reason not to give people compensation and claim that you have a tunnel … The children and I were staying with relatives, and sometimes we went to my husband and lit a fire and talked about our memories and each moment we had in the house. The rain reminded us of all the winters we spent together over 10 years. I remembered when I was pregnant, and when I had my first son and we celebrated. I remembered Ramadan and our relatives around us. I remembered our grandparents who were buried here and now we’re leaving them. Even the cemeteries would be lost and we would have no one to visit or pray for each time we miss them.  No Compensation for Lost Income  The government did not give displaced residents compensation for losing their source of income or jobs as a result of the eviction.  Um Mohamed told Human Rights Watch that her husband had owned a business in Rafah that is not needed in al-Arish because the economy there is not based on agriculture. He spent “ages” in his career, and they don’t know how he will find another job, she said. She was a government employee in Rafah, but her employer said they had no orders yet to transfer her to al-Arish.  Yousef owned around 8,000 square meters of land that had been farmed with olive trees, almonds, oranges and vegetables. The farm provided them with food as well as a source of income, as his family used to lease it to farmers. The army leveled Yousef’s farms with no notice and did not provide compensation for them.  “It’s hard to see the land that my mother and father cared for themselves and carried the water to the trees … and their happiness when they saw the plants grow from their efforts. The state has always been absent and it’s never given us any services. After we populated [the land] and built and exhausted ourselves to reclaim the land and live and protect the border, they suddenly come and destroy everything, this is the biggest feeling of oppression and humiliation,” he said.  Sameh and his brother and father used to run two shops that earned around 3,000 pounds per month and cost only 600 pounds to rent. In al-Arish, it might cost him around 5,000 pounds per month to rent a store, he said. Because he could not compete with other shops in al-Arish, Sameh opened his shop in Sheikh Zuweid. But there, he couldn’t make more than 50 pounds per day and paid 35 pounds for transportation. The army has forced him to close in the late afternoon because of the curfew.  “How will we survive,” he asked.  Hajja Zaynab said that her older son used to work in trade and agriculture and cannot find a job in al-Arish.  Interruption of Children’s Education  Families who had children in schools told Human Rights Watch that it was very difficult to transfer their children to other schools in the Sinai. Most families’ children missed a semester. One resident told Human Rights Watch that she has not been able to find an alternative school for her child. Those who did find alternatives had to rely on connections in government to do so. The government appeared to have no plan to compensate for the effect of demolishing at least six schools in the buffer zone and did not give families information about an alternative.  Um Mohamed told Human Rights Watch that her two children will miss a year of school. When she went to a school in al-Arish to see if they could be transferred there, the school said it had no space to enroll them. Other families in Rafah with “connections” managed to transfer their children, Um Mohamed said, but she cannot.  Fatma told Human Rights Watch that the government “could have, at least, made some consideration for us and waited for the cold blizzard and the first school semester to end…but they were rushing as they didn’t want to give a space for people to wake up and stop the eviction.”  Abu Ismail said his family could not transfer his daughter to a new school in al-Arish for the first school semester because there was no space, so they conducted her exams in a nearby district where other displaced families also sent their children. By the second school semester, he managed to transfer her to a school in al-Arish. He blamed the state for its “absence of plans” and the “arbitrariness” of the eviction and said it was “beyond schools’ capacities [to find a place for everyone].”  Marzouk kept his children at home and made them take exams at the same location as Abu Ismail’s daughter. He said the family would “see what we can do” at the end of the school year, after final exams.  Mohsen, who has two children in schools, said his wife taught his children at home during the evictions and that they took their mid-year exams in another school in Rafah. When the family moved to al-Arish, he managed to transfer them to a school.  “Some families even bought the desks for their kids. But it was easier for me because I had a relative who works in education,” he said.  IV. Legal Framework  Demolitions under International Humanitarian Law  Though international human rights law laid out in United Nations and African conventions to which Egypt is a party applies at all times, the insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula may constitute a situation of armed conflict triggering the application of different standards under international humanitarian law, also known as the laws of war, as well.  International law recognizes two types of armed conflict: international, fought between states, and non-international, fought between a state and an armed group or between different armed groups. Non-international armed conflicts are defined by Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, which were supplemented in 1977 by Article 1 of the Conventions’ Additional Protocol II.  Under prevailing interpretations of the Geneva Conventions, a non-international armed conflict occurs when:  Hostilities are protracted armed confrontations between government forces and armed groups that have reached a serious level of intensity such that, for example, a state is obliged to use its military forces against its adversary instead of the police and;  The armed groups involved in the conflict are organized, such that they have a command structure and ability to sustain military operations  The Additional Protocol II further defined a non-international conflict as one in which the armed group can “exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations” and implement humanitarian law, should they choose to do so. International courts have previously described other, more specific conditions of non-international armed conflicts.  Because of the Egyptian government’s refusal to allow media or humanitarian access to North Sinai and the secrecy with which the armed group Sinai Province, previously known as Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, conducts its operations, it is extremely difficult to assess the group’s organization and strategic planning from publically available sources for the purposes of the armed conflict test under international law.  Egyptian authorities and the Sinai Province group itself have occasionally named important members of the group, including “field commander” Tawfiq Farij and “top leader” Shehata Farhan, who were both killed in 2014. But such reports rarely provide clarity and often lead to contradictory descriptions of the group’s organization.  Since the ouster of former president Mohamed Morsy in 2013, Egyptian authorities have at times tried to assign responsibility to the Morsy administration for releasing once-jailed Islamists who then allegedly joined or assisted insurgents in Sinai. In fact, most of these Islamists had been pardoned under the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), the group of generals that governed Egypt after the fall of Hosni Mubarak in 2011, according to publicly available data. The SCAF released more than 800 imprisoned Islamists, while Morsy released at least 27.  Those released included some who had served long prison terms for terrorism-related offenses, including involvement in the 1981 assassination of former president Anwar al-Sadat. They included members of the Islamic Group, an extremist offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that renounced violence in the 2000s; Mohamed al-Zawahiri, the brother of al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and himself the leader of the Salafi Jihad group; and former operatives of Islamic Jihad, the militant group whose members assassinated Sadat and which later merged with al-Qaeda under Ayman al-Zawahiri’s leadership. Nabil al-Maghraby, another man accused of participating in the plot to kill al-Sadat, was also released.  In August 2013, following Morsy’s removal, the authorities rearrested Mohamed al-Zawahiri, who had penned a Facebook post urging opposition to the military. In October 2013, they rearrested al-Maghraby, accusing him of participating in the failed assassination attempt by Ansar Beit al-Maqdis on former Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim. In December, State Security prosecutors accused Ahmed Salama Mabrouk, another former Islamic Jihad operative, of aiding Ansar Beit al-Maqdis.  Egyptian authorities arrested another one-time Islamic Jihad member, Muhammad Jamal, in November 2012, a little more than a year after his release following the uprising. The US State Department designated Jamal a “global terrorist” in October 2013, saying he had also once trained with al-Qaeda, established training camps in Libya and Egypt after his release in 2011, and sought assistance from Ayman al-Zawahiri. The authorities have connected Jamal to members of Ansar Beit al-Maqdis.  Meanwhile, the authorities also gave conflicting accounts regarding the leadership of Ansar Beit al-Maqdis. State Security prosecutors identified Mabrouk, the former jailed Islamic Jihad operative, as the “actual leader” of the group, according to the newspaper al-Shorouk. But in May 2014, the authorities claimed to have killed another man, Shadi al-Menai, whom they also called the group’s leader, only for the group itself to release a statement saying that al-Menai was neither dead nor its leader. In January 2015, the newspaper al-Masry al-Youm, citing a security source, identified yet another man, Abu Osama al-Masry, who had previously appeared as one of Ansar Beit al-Maqdis’s main preachers, as the group’s leader. But in May, members of the Tarabin tribe kidnapped al-Menai’s brother and offered a one-million-pound ($131,000) bounty for al-Menai’s death, labeling him the leader of the Sinai Province group.  Despite this uncertainty about the group’s command structure, statements by both the group itself and Egyptian security officials point to a nexus between the Sinai Province group and veteran jihadists, such as Mabrouk and Jamal, who have experience with armed groups such as Islamic Jihad and would have knowledge about the procurement of funds and arms and how to plan military operations. Former members of the Egyptian military who may have left and fought in the Syrian war have also reportedly planned and carried out attacks for the group. Egyptian authorities connected Walid Badr, a former army major whom the group said carried out the assassination attempt on Ibrahim, to both Jamal and Maghraby. Israeli and Egyptian security sources have also alleged connections between Ansar Beit al-Maqdis and militant groups in Gaza. When a 28-year-old man and alleged member of the Gaza-based Popular Resistance Committees was wounded in an Israeli air strike in February 2014, Israel’s General Security Agency, or Shabak, claimed that he had also smuggled arms to Ansar Beit al-Maqdis. Other analysts have pointed to statements sympathetic to Ansar Beit al-Maqdis issued by Gaza-based groups, such as the Mujahideen Shura Council, as evidence of collaboration.  Sinai Province’s formal pledge of allegiance to ISIS has likely provided the group with better access to money and weapons. The group appears to exercise some territorial control, often in the form of checkpoints, and has handed out food and money to residents affected by the unrest. Since pledging allegiance to ISIS, the group appears to have increased the sophistication of its media operation and is able to regularly issue public statements on its behalf, often accompanied by pictures and carefully edited videos. For these reasons, the Sinai Province group appears sufficiently organized to sustain military operations.  It may also be the case that the conflict between the government and the group has reached a “level of intensity” to be considered a non-international armed conflict.  The Sinai Province group has launched large, coordinated assaults on government positions in North Sinai in October 2014, January 2015 and July 2015, likely killing more than 100 Egyptian soldiers, according to local media outlets. The July 1, 2015, attack on the town of Sheikh Zuweid in North Sinai may have been the largest insurgent attack in Egypt’s modern history and marked the first time that insurgents in Sinai temporarily seized populated territory. Only attacks by Egyptian air force F-16 fighter jets managed to drive the fighters out of Sheikh Zuweid after 12 hours of combat. The Sinai Province group has also used sophisticated guided missiles to destroy tanks, shoot down at least one Egyptian military helicopter and severely damage at least one Egyptian navy vessel.  More than 3,600 people, including civilians, security forces and alleged insurgents, died in North Sinai governorate between July 2013 and July 2015, according to media reports and government statements aggregated by the Washington, DC-based Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. Roughly 2,650 people, about 73 percent of those who died, were reportedly killed after the first major attack by the Sinai Province group on October 24, 2014. North Sinai has witnessed about 320 attacks by armed groups between the October 2014 attack and July 2015, compared to 105 attacks over the previous nine months. The number of government counterinsurgency operations surged from 177 to 451 over the same time period. During that time, the Egyptian security forces reportedly killed 2,368 people in those operations. Of the 283 people killed in insurgent attacks in North Sinai between the October 2014 and July 2015, 64 percent died in attacks attributed to Ansar Beit al-Maqdis or the Sinai Province group.  In response to this insurgency, the Egyptian military has deployed thousands of military troops, armored vehicles, tanks and helicopters at a level not seen in the Sinai Peninsula since the 1973 war with Israel. For these reasons, it may well be the case that the fighting between Egypt and the Sinai Province group has been a non-international armed conflict since at least October 2014.  The Egyptian authorities have justified the home demolitions and forced evictions carried out since the attack by Ansar Beit al-Maqdis in October 2014 as a way to defeat the Sinai insurgents by preventing them from receiving arms, supplies and fighters from the Gaza Strip through smuggling tunnels.  A statement on the Defense Ministry’s website the day before the issuance of the October 2014 buffer zone decree, referring to insurgents as takfiri, or Muslims who accuse others of being infidels, explained that the Gaza smuggling tunnels were “one of the main sources for the entry of armed takfiri groups and elements to Sinai and the provision of logistical support to them and supply to them of arms and ammunition.” The statement described the buffer zone as a way to “finally eliminate the problem” of tunnels. Maj. Gen. Abd al-Fattah Harhour, the governor of North Sinai, said the decree was intended “to defend Egypt from terrorism.” Other authorities have named other tangential benefits to the buffer zone: One advisor to the military’s Commanders and Staff College told a newspaper that the buffer zone would have the benefits of putting the zone under military court jurisdiction and clearing it of civilians, so that it would “be regarded as an open theater.”  “The buffer zone should have been established for years already. Why so? Because this buffer zone is impacting the region of Sinai and the security in Egypt generally speaking,” al-Sisi said in a televised interview in November 2014. “We have borders, direct borders between the Egyptian population and the Gaza Strip. Obviously this area was not fully controlled in terms of activities or trafficking.”  Central to the laws of war that govern armed conflict is the principle of distinction, which requires parties to a conflict to distinguish at all times between combatants and civilians. Operations may be directed only against combatants and other military objectives; civilians and civilian objects may not be targeted. The laws of war also prohibit the forced displacement of civilians “unless the security of the civilians involved or imperative military reasons so demand.”  Civilian objects have been defined as all objects that are not military objectives. Military objectives are those objects which “by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.” In case of doubt, there is a presumption that objects normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as houses, schools, places of worship, and hospitals, are not subject to attack. Civilian objects remain protected from attack, unless they become military objectives. But once a civilian object, such as a house used as a military headquarters, ceases being used to further the military aims of the adversary, it can no longer be attacked.  Deliberate, indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks against civilians and civilian objects are prohibited. A disproportionate attack is one in which the expected incidental loss of civilian life or damage to civilian objects would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.  A civilian object can be a military objective if an armed group anticipates a concrete advantage to be had in the future by targeting it, but the presumption that a civilian object is not a military objective remains. Acting on the basis of the enemy’s possible intentions is not sufficient to justify an attack on a civilian object. “Purpose is predicated on intentions known to guide the adversary, and not on those figured out hypothetically in contingency plans based on a ‘worst case scenario,’” wrote one academic commentator.  The large-scale destruction of entire neighborhoods in Rafah does not appear to meet the requirement under international humanitarian law that the army target only specific military objectives and that damage to civilian objects that results should not be excessive in relation to the direct and concrete military advantage anticipated. Rather than targeting specific tunnels and limiting excessive damage, the pattern of destruction in Rafah is consistent with the goal of having a wide and empty border area to facilitate border control, and Egyptian officials have stated this themselves. Egyptian military authorities have not limited their demolitions to the tunnels and have destroyed thousands of civilian houses and buildings, apparently failing both to distinguish between military and civilian objects and to limit the destruction of civilian objects within the proportionality required.  Additionally, though smuggling tunnels could be considered military objectives insofar as they are being used or will be used to transport weapons or fighters into Egypt, there remains almost no evidence to support the Egyptian army’s justification that all Sinai-Gaza tunnels contribute to Sinai-based insurgent groups fighting Egyptian forces. Though Egyptian military officials—and occasionally their Israeli counterparts—have alleged that armed groups in the Sinai use the tunnels to receive weapons and logistical support from Gaza, they have not provided proof.  More importantly, numerous media reports and statements by both foreign and Egyptian government officials have identified Libya and Sudan as the primary sources of weapons that reach the Sinai and have explained that weapons are smuggled from the Sinai to Gaza, not vice versa. On July 1, 2015, following the unprecedented attack on military positions in North Sinai by fighters of the Sinai Province group, Gen. Samir Farag, head of the armed forces’ Morale Affairs department, told a television program that military officers in North Sinai “saw weapons that they hadn’t seen anywhere but in catalogues,” and that these weapons had come from Libya. Most of the heavy weapons in use or intercepted by the authorities in the Sinai, including surface-to-air missiles, rockets and antiaircraft guns, were smuggled from Libya directly to the Sinai and bought, stockpiled and resold within the Sinai, according to media reports that cited Egyptian military officials and the head of the multinational peacekeeping force based in the Sinai. Israel’s General Security Agency, also known as Shabak, reported in a year-end review of 2012 that “hundreds of standard and quality weapons,” including long-range, anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, had been smuggled from Sudan and Libya into Gaza through the Sinai. Sealing the tunnels arguably has greater military utility for Israel, which faces an armed adversary in the Gaza Strip, than Egypt, but Egypt has not cited Israel’s defense needs to justify its demolitions in Rafah, only its own. The military advantage of destroying all tunnels is thus highly uncertain for Egypt, and Human Rights Watch found that the wholesale destruction of neighborhoods greatly exceeded the Egyptian army's stated need to end tunnel smuggling.  The tunnels also serve as a crucial lifeline of basic supplies for the besieged Gaza Strip. As of 2011, they were bringing in $700 million worth of goods annually, including 800,000 liters of fuel, 3,000 tons of gravel, 500 tons of steel rods and 3,000 tons of cement every day.  In addition, despite the tremendous burden that demolitions have imposed on the civilian population, the Egyptian army has failed to explain why it cannot use along the Rafah border non-destructive means for detecting and neutralizing tunnels employed in places like the Mexico-United States border and the Korean demilitarized zone. These means could include ground penetrating radar or electromagnetic induction to detect materials in the ground. Moreover, Egypt is known to have experience with a third: laser radar vibration sensors.  As early as 2008, after the United States and Israel had put new pressure on Egypt to halt tunnel smuggling to Gaza, the US Army Corps of Engineers was reportedly training Egyptian troops to use “advanced technological equipment…including instruments that measure ground fluctuations and signal that a tunnel is being dug.” This training, on equipment purchased by Egypt from the United States, continued in 2009. In August 2013, the defense company Raytheon received a $9.9 million contract from the US Defense Department—paid for with Egypt’s US-provided military aid—to continue with “research and development” on a tunnel detection system in Egypt. This system was Raytheon’s Seismic and Acoustic Vibration Imaging program, which uses lasers to detect minute vibrations in the ground, revealing tunnels. The Egyptian authorities have not explained why they did not or could not use this technology to locate specific tunnels.  Furthermore, Egypt has not explained the widely varying figures authorities have provided for the number of tunnels they have destroyed or the discrepancy between official statements that the army destroyed up to 1,400 tunnels since July 2013 and a United Nations statement claiming that as few as 10 tunnels were operating at one point in 2013. It is possible that the Egyptian authorities did not distinguish, in their public statements, between tunnel access shafts and actual tunnels. Human Rights Watch found only one instance, in May 2015, when the armed forces’ spokesman referenced access shafts, claiming that troops had closed 521 between October 2014 and April 2015. But a month later, the armed forces claimed to have destroyed 1,429 smuggling tunnels since January 2014.  Because the government could have and did use other methods to close the tunnels and halt smuggling, apparently possessed the technology and training to detect specific tunnels, and has not made clear how many actual tunnels have been closed as a result of the buffer zone, the mass demolition of at least 3,255 buildings along the Sinai-Gaza border, displacing thousands of families, appears to have been disproportionate.  Eviction and Destruction of Homes under International Human Rights Law  Regardless of whether the fighting in North Sinai has amounted to an armed conflict, the eviction of the population and the destruction of homes is also subject to international human rights law, particularly the right to housing under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, ratified by Egypt in 1982 and the right to property under the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights.  Those evicted outside active hostilities are entitled various protections, including: genuine consultation with the authorities; adequate and reasonable notice; information on the eviction and future use of the land; adequate compensation or alternative housing; legal remedies; and legal aid. International law prohibits \"forced evictions,\" defined as the permanent or temporary removal of individuals, families or communities against their will from their homes or land, without access to appropriate forms of legal or other protection. Egypt is also obliged to protect the right to property, as set out in the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, to which it is a party. This includes recognizing individuals’ and groups’ property rights over homes and land they have traditionally occupied, whether or not they had written documentation. Evictions should be a last resort and accompanied with fair compensation.  The interference with peoples’ right to a home and property can only be justified if it is not arbitrary (i.e. the power to do so is set out in clear domestic law) and if it is done for a legitimate reason and in a proportionate manner (i.e. the least restrictive way to achieve the aim). Given the extent of the interference in the rights to home and property caused by these evictions and home destructions, the Egyptian authorities will need to have strong evidence that this was the only option they had.  The home demolitions and evictions in North Sinai violated many of these protections, including those concerning notification, consultation, compensation, and temporary housing. The evictions do not appear to have abided by Egyptian law either. The buffer zone decree, for instance, stated that the government must provide alternative housing for those displaced by the evictions. The government did not do so. The General Mobilization Law of 1960, which formed part of the basis of the buffer zone decree, applies to cases of war or general mobilization and allows property expropriations only “for the sake of martial efforts.” Egypt has not formally declared war or general mobilization. Both the General Mobilization Law and the Emergency Law (Law 162 of 1958) allow only temporary expropriations. They do not address home demolitions. Finally, Article 63 of Egypt’s constitution prohibits “arbitrary forced displacement of citizens” and makes it a crime.

      "El Comité de Operaciones de Emergencia (COE) del Carchi se activó la tarde de ayer, tras subir de alerta amarilla a naranja por el incremento en la actividad sísmica de los volcanes Chiles y Cerro Negro.  En los cantones Tulcán y Espejo se sintieron con más fuerza los temblores que tuvieron una magnitud de hasta 5,9 grados en la escala de Richter. Allí se hicieron evaluaciones de las afectaciones a casas y vías.    Uno de los daños de magnitud está en la carretera Tufiño- Maldonado, en el noroccidente de Tulcán. Ahí, 25 obreros del Ministerio de Transporte y Obras Públicas limpiaron la vía, pese a que el peligro continuaba latente, por la continua caída de rocas y tierra.    El bloqueo se registra a 13 km de Tufiño. Ahí, una retroexcavadora estaba estacionada junto a rocas de 1,50 m de altura. Más arriba, en el km 32, se escuchaban constantemente ruidos que llegaban desde la parte alta del cerro Chiles y causaban temor.    La cuadrilla vial suspendió los trabajos de reapertura del camino, en el tramo conocido como Lagunas Verdes–Potrerillos, a las 14:00 de ayer.    “La tierra tiembla mucho. No tenemos garantías para trabajar y debemos respetar la alerta naranja”, agregó Darwin Donoso, funcionario del Ministerio.    Junto a Lagunas Verdes, hay fisuras en la mesa de la carretera. Según los técnicos de Obras Públicas, está a punto de perderse la calzada de la única vía que enlaza a las parroquias de Tufiño y Maldonado.    Estos daños se produjeron porque la actividad en los volcanes Chiles, en Ecuador, y Cerro Negro, en Colombia, se reanudó desde el 29 de abril, según informó Mario Ruiz, director del Instituto Geofísico de la Politécnica Nacional.    “Dentro del volcán hay presiones. Nuestra tarea es ver cómo se van a manifestar esas reacciones, y cómo el magma está forzando para salir”.    Pese a que los obreros del Ministerio lograron habilitar un carril en la carretera para la circulación de ambulancias entre Tufiño y Maldonado o viceversa, el paso para vehículos y personas a pie está restringido por esta vía, por seguridad.    De acuerdo con Omar Chamorro, director provincial del Ministerio, se deben retirar piedras en una longitud de 20 km. Para entrar o salir de Maldonado, explicó, se puede usar la ruta alterna Chical-El Carmen.    Sin embargo, informó que en el km 25 hay un solo carril de circulación, debido a los continuos derrumbes que se producen por las lluvias.    Entre tanto, en el centro poblado de Tufiño, el patio de comidas del mercado fue cerrado al público, por prevención.    Las 12 vendedoras esperan que los eventos sísmicos no ahuyenten a los turistas. Se calcula que llegan entre 2 000 y  2 500 los fines de semana, según datos de la Junta Parroquial.  Ernesto Tatamués, teniente político de Tufiño, confirmó que las clases fueron suspendidas en la Unidad Educativa Los Ríos de esa parroquia.    Dos casas y la iglesia de la comuna de San Nicolás, otras dos en Santa Bárbara y una en Maspaz fueron afectadas por los fuertes remezones.    Jairo Enríquez, vecino de Chiles, en Colombia, dice en son de broma que estos poblados comparten la frontera hasta con los sismos.    En el cantón Espejo, en cambio, la situación es preocupante. El Cuerpo de Bomberos ordenó la evacuación de cinco familias por el peligro de que sus casas se caigan.    Los rescatistas contabilizaron 51 viviendas en todo el cantón que resultaron afectadas por los últimos temblores.    El alcalde Lenin Carrera manifestó que esperan el aporte de entidades del Gobierno Nacional, debido a que los recursos municipales son escasos. No obstante, utilizarán un fondo de emergencia para ayudar a las familias que lo necesiten.    En la parroquia La Libertad la situación es más crítica. Tres familias de los barrios San Isidro, Jesús del Gran Poder y Santa Teresita están a punto de perder sus viviendas.    Vitelma Pérez, vecina de El Ángel, decidió desde el lunes último pernoctar bajo una improvisada carpa que instaló en el patio de su casa. Su cocina está destruida. Los techos se desprendieron y hay varias paredes que están cuarteadas.    Los más afectados son los estudiantes de la Unidad Santa Mariana de Jesús, de El Ángel, donde las clases fueron suspendidas. La edificación tiene grandes grietas y las autoridades están preocupadas porque no tienen recursos para rehabilitar la infraestructura. Los padres de familia de los 278 alumnos están desconcertados.  En Tufiño y Espejo consideran que hay falta de respuesta de las autoridades. Los damnificados de Espejo se quejan de que no han llegado alimentos ni vituallas. Mientras que en Tufiño piden carpas ya que están durmiendo a la intemperie, abrigados solo con una fogata.\n",

      "Inclement weather has left regions of Egypt at a standstill as authorities grasp at solutions. (Twitter)  Follow > Disable alert for Alexandria Disable alert for army Disable alert for Beheira Disable alert for Cairo Disable alert for Sherif Ismail Follow >  Eleven people were killed in floods in Beheira province north of Cairo, a security source said, and authorities evacuated 100 people from a village in the province as Egypt suffers from a second round of stormy weather in less than a month.    The evacuees are from a village in Wadi al-Natrun valley located in Beheira province. The village was completely inundated in rainwater.    The military has had to intervene in Beheira and evacuations are still ongoing.    Prime Minister Sherif Ismail is on his way to visit the coastal province later today, state run television reported.    A dozen trucks were sent to Beheira province, home to Wadi al-Natrun, to deal with the flash floods, the housing minister had said in a statement earlier.    As Egypt faces another bout of stormy weather in just a couple of weeks, many eyes are turning to Alexandria, where the military has also had to intervene, sending out relief and drainage trucks.    On social media, Egyptians are using the hashtag #Alexandria_drowns, which has been repeated in nearly 29,000 tweets, as of publishing time.    Water has collected in several parts of the coastal province and underneath bridges, as local authorities dispatched drainage cars and cleaned out drainage networks. Many cars and stores were damaged across the province.    Expressing his anger, one citizen said \"each time we know ahead\" that this \"crisis\" is going to happen, but \"no one takes action\" and the army has to be involved every time to solve the problem.    Last month, Alexandria was flooded after heavy rains which killed five citizens, many in electrocution accidents.    The mismanagement of the crisis in Alexandria last month led to the resignation of Alexandria's governor, amid heavy public criticism.    Two ports in Alexandria were shut down today for the second day in a row, as heavy rain affected transportation and traffic movement, as well people trying to reach their workplaces and students on their way to school.    The news of heavy rain descending on several Egyptian provinces has prompted the prime minister to allow governors to declare public holidays at schools and government institutions today and tomorrow at their own discretion.    This authority has already been used up in Alexandria where public employees and schools are going to be off on Thursday, state run television reported.    The weather is expected to remain unstable on Thursday, with heavy rains forecast in the north coast, in Sinai and the Red Sea Hills. Heavy winds are expected to sweep over both the Red Sea and theMediterranean, leading to troubled navigation.  By Hend Kortam\n",

      "Enrique Guevara in Panama    Heavy rain is not a new phenomenon in Andean region of South America. But despite the serious disruption the rains often cause to the lives and livelihoods of thousands, their ‘regularity’ means they’re often under-reported or fail to capture greater public attention.    In early 2012 Ecuador was hit by a series of intense storms causing floods, burst riverbanks and landslides. Volunteers from the Ecuadorian Red Cross immediately took action in the worst-hit provinces to rescue and evacuate affected people, provide pre-hospital care and psychosocial support, and assess the extent of the damage and needs.    Teresa Basurto is a mother of three. Her youngest son is 14 and studies over 300km from his home in La Armenia; her two older boys have married and left home. When a fierce storm hit the district, Teresa’s home was flooded and she lost her rice crops, chickens and pigs – her three main sources of income for the family.    Fortunately her home, made from cane and a zinc roof, withstood the battering but she was warned to stay away during the worst of the weather due to a risk of more flooding. A short period of evacuation, in which Teresa stayed with family, turned into a month and a half away from home.    Teresa remembers that the situation got worse because that she did not have a job, but with the help of friends who gave her rice seeds she was able to work again. Regaining this source of income was vital and allowed her to buy cured rice and use it as seed.    Teresa’s experience is far from unique. The National Secretariat for Risk Management in Ecuador says the storm affected over 121,000 people. More than 7,340 people had to evacuate their homes to stay in shelters or with family members. The floods damaged or destroyed homes, schools, roads, bridges and other crucial infrastructure.    With support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and funding from the European Commission’s Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO), the Ecuadorian Red Cross provided food assistance and hygiene kits and, spread messages on disease prevention and health promotion among families in the coastal provinces of Manabi, Los Rios and Guayas.    The effects of the storms on agriculture have a significant impact on a community’s ability to recover. Rodolfo Carriel is a farmer who lives in Bebo in the district of Salitre. He is a veteran of many floods, but the severity of the disaster in 2012 took him by surprise.    When the storm hit, Rodolfo was in the Community Committee of Salitre and responded to the emergency with friends from the Committee. A 20 meter wall collapsed causing a massive flood which left his family with no rice crops, no animals and a patch of land incapable of supporting his work. The family was devastated. “We were almost left homeless,” he says.    Along with emergency assistance, the Ecuadorian Red Cross also began preparing the communities for the risk of waterborne diseases such as dengue that can sometimes arise after significant flooding. “I feel very thankful because the help arrived just when we needed it,” Rodolfo says.    Teresa fears that if this year’s floods are as bad, the communities will not be fully prepared, but at least, through programmes supported by the Ecuadorian Red Cross, IFRC and ECHO, they are aware of the risks and know some of the things they can do to lessen the impact.\n",

      "/ Front page / News  ABOUT 800 people who are badly affected by the depression over the Central and Eastern parts of Viti Levu are still living within the confines of evacuation centres after most of them lost their belongings from the floods on Thursday and Friday last week.  Although a number of evacuation centres have closed, 17 still remain open and are housing evacuees, many of whom are from the highlands of Naitasiri.  \"The number we've given (about 800) are the number of the villagers — the population of the villages basically.  \"They are staying in community halls and churches at the moment,\" explained National Disaster Management Office director Manasa Tagicakibau in an interview yesterday.  Mr Tagicakibau said : \"Most of the evacuation centres have closed, the figure we have is that 10 have closed and 17 are still open.\"  He said the NDMO response teams worked hard throughout the weekend to get relief rations to the evacuees.  \"Response teams are moving into these evacuation centres to at least provide them with some relief rations because most of the people who came into the evacuation centres — because their houses were flooded — they came in with nothing but the clothes on their backs.  \"But relief rations are to the evacuation centres only though, not to the community at large — just the centres and we provided rations to sustain them for at least two days.\"  He said the office was working to get the evacuees back on their feet and close down all evacuation centres by tomorrow at the latest.\n",

      "France has been suffering from floods throughout May, 2013. On May 4 in the Burgundy region, torrential rain resulted in some residents of the city of Dijon being evacuated,. Levels of the River Ouche were rising rapidly after about 1 month’s worth of rain had poured in just under 12 hours until it eventually burst its banks. Three people were reported to be trapped in their homes, but were later rescued by the emergency services. Also early in May water levels of the Saône river in Lyon were particularly high, as were the Isère and Rhône near Valence.  Floods are still occurring in France more than a week later. On May 9 the historic town of Troyes was hit by flooding. Troyes lies 170 km from Paris, in the Aube department (administrative region) which remained on “Orange” alert (warnings issued by the French national meteorological serviceMétéo France). Orange is the second highest flood alert. The Marne, Meuse and Seine-et-Marne departments remain on yellow alert.  France has already suffered from serious flooding this year. In Mach a state of emergency was declared as floods hit the south western Pyrenees Orientales region. Here the levels of the River Agly were so high, forecasters feared they would reach the levels of the worst floods on 1999. Flooding was so bad in March 2013 that a woman motorist was killed near Perpignan as her car was swept away by the flood waters of the river. About 700 residents were evacuated from their homes in the area at the foot of the Pyrenees. Flooding also hit the Rhone Valley in south east France.  Source: RFI; UPI ; The Connexion\n",

      "Image: Tuomas Hirvonen / Yle  Rapidly moving ice floes choking the local river have caused flooding in the Pyhäjoki downtown area. Officials say the situation may worsen if the natural ice dams aren’t broken up.  Emergency service workers have evacuated about 30 people from the flooded areas. Nine detached homes, two terraced homes and two summer cottages have been inundated by overflows from the river.  “People simply didn’t have time to leave their homes before the water came up the stairs and even into their homes,” said head of Pyhäjoki rescue services Jarmo Haapanen.  Several outdoor annexes in the area were also damaged in the rapidly rising flood waters, however no one was reported injured so far.  Rescue officials were busy building flood barriers to protect buildings in the flooding zone. Backup for the operation was provided by Border Guard helicopter patrols, which provided aerial surveillance.  “There is a risk that if the ice dam moves on and then gets stuck again, there will be flooding in a new area,” Haapanen explained.  The city of Pyhäjoki has set up temporary care facilities and emergency accomodation for residents evacuated from their homes. Those in need of housing should call 040 3596 053 or 040 3596 001.  With a population of just 3,000, Pyhäjoki is located in northern Ostrobothnia between Raahe and Kalajoki.\n",

      "Nineteen people are feared dead after violent storms and severe flooding swept the French Riviera, including three people who drowned in a retirement home after a river broke its banks.    Heavy flooding along the Côte d’Azur on Saturday saw the river Brague burst its banks close to the city of Antibes, flooding a home for elderly people.  The French president, François Hollande, confirmed at least 16 people had died and three were missing. The interior ministry said earlier in the morning there was little hope of finding the missing people alive.  “It’s not over,” Hollande said as he arrived at the flooded retirement home and met emergency service workers. “The toll is not yet finalised. In times like this, we must be fast, efficient and coordinated.” He warned locals to take care on local roads, which are covered with slippery mud.  At least seven people drowned after their cars became trapped in underground car parks, according to rescue teams in Mandelieu-la Napoule, with the commune’s mayor, Henri Leroy, warning more bodies may be found.  “It’s apocalyptic,” he told Agence France-Presse. “The parking was half-emptied but there are thousands of vehicles. There could be more bodies.”  Three people drowned when their car became stuck in rising waters inside a narrow tunnel near Vallauris Golfe-Juan, authorities said.  A woman in her 60s is reported to have died in the street in Cannes when huge storms hit the region on Saturday. Water and debris coursed down roads in the festival town and in the neighbouring city of Nice. Another victim was found dead at a campsite in Antibes, according to officials.  More than 17cm (6.7in) of rain fell on the Cannes region in two hours, radio France Bleu Azur reported.  Obama declares state of emergency in South Carolina over floods Read more  Guardian journalist Stuart Dredge, attending the MIPJunior television conference in Cannes, said the venue for the event had been flooded. He said he had walked knee-deep in water on his way home on Saturday night after watching the England-Australia Rugby World Cup match.  “By half time, the street outside was running with water, and the main Rue d’Antibes road in Cannes was between ankle and knee-deep at its lower points,” he said.  “The crossroads were the most dangerous parts: the water really was pouring down from the higher ground with strong currents – and a fair few people walking home had been drinking, so their balance would have been a bit impaired already.”  Stuart Dredge (@stuartdredge) Seriously though, this is the state of Cannes' main thoroughfare right now pic.twitter.com/xk2V429l9X  Dredge said he did not see anyone fall into the water, although some moped drivers needed assistance. “This morning, there are a few cars that have clearly been swept along and deposited leaning against railings. When I got home the power was out in my building, but it came back on again shortly before midnight.  “I think Cannes probably got off lightly, comparably. It was a hairy walk home, but I didn’t feel in true danger,” he added.  Flooding in Cannes  “Some cars were carried off into the sea,” said Cannes’ mayor, David Lisnard, describing water levels reaching halfway up car doors and trees left uprooted on the city’s main street.    “We have rescued a lot of people, and we must now be vigilant against looting,” he added, announcing that an emergency plan to mobilise police, emergency responders and municipal services.  British journalist Sarah Kovandzich said she was in Le Crillon bar a few streets back from the seafront when she and her companions saw water running past the door.  “I’ve never seen anything like it in Cannes,” she said. “The water started to seep into the bar, then we were up to our ankles, people were putting their feet up on the chairs. Outside, you could see plant pots and flowers just being carried along the road by the water.”  Kovandzich said the walk home was daunting because the flooding had removed manhole covers. “You couldn’t immediately see where the holes might be because of the flowing water.”  The power was out in her apartment and water was dripping through the ceiling, she said.  One social media user compared the scenes in Cannes on Sunday morning to the zombie TV series The Walking Dead, posting pictures of several damaged cars.  Jer Crunchant ™ (@jercrunchant) Les rues de #Cannes ont un air de \"The Walking Dead\" ce matin, sauf que ce n'est pas de la fiction #jamaisvuca pic.twitter.com/dFACFwtM0Q  France’s interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, was also due to visit the area on Sunday morning to inspect rescue efforts, his spokesman said.  Hollande thanked rescuers and politicians for their work, praising the “solidarity of the nation” and offering condolences to the victims’ families, while the prime minister, Manuel Valls, spoke of his “deep emotion” on hearing of the deaths.  The Elysée palace announced on Sunday that victims of the flooding will receive help from the state under a French law that gives compensation to victims of natural disasters. A tweet from the president’s office said it would be paid within three months.  The areas worst hit by flooding were also the hardest to access, officials said, raising fears the death toll could rise. About 27,000 homes remained without power early on Sunday, 14,000 of them in Cannes.  French rail company SNCF said about a dozen trains carrying hundreds of people had to be halted for safety reasons, while roads around Antibes were also flooded, according to French emergency services. Train services are still cancelled between Toulon and Nice, a spokesman said on Sunday, adding that further delays are likely.  “Campsites are under water, and two helicopters are circling to ensure the public’s security, as some people are stuck on the roof of their caravans,” said a spokeswoman for the fire brigade.  Up to 500 tourists, including several Britons and Danes, sought shelter overnight at Nice airport, while a Nice versus Nantes football match was interrupted by the downpours.  French weather forecasters said the worst storms had now passed over the French mainland and were heading for the Italian coast.  More than 120 people are staying in temporary shelters in Cannes, according to city authorities. Donations for those who have lost belongings in the floods are being organised in an emergency drive by French charity Secours Populaire.\n",

      "Period covered by this update:  26 July – 2 August 2013  Summary: On 25th July 2013, CHF 121,847 CHF was initially allocated from the IFRC’s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the Georgia Red Cross Society in delivering immediate assistance to 380 families (1900 beneficiaries). Due to the continuation of the adverse weather conditions and newly arisen needs, however, the National Society has now revised its operational plans together with its budget. The revised total budget for this operation amounts to CHF 215,194. Based on the most recent needs assessment, a total of 680 families (3400 beneficiaries) will thus be targeted throughout Georgia. Unearmarked funds to repay DREF are encouraged.  On 19th and few days later, on 29th July 2013, extended heavy rains caused considerable damages in several parts of Georgia. A total of 4,800 families (24,000 people) have been affected in the following regions Samegrelo, Guria, Ajara, Mtskheta - Mtianeti. The western part of Georgia was the most affected. In Samegrelo region more than 20 villages and Senaki town were severely affected by the floods.  Houses, agricultural lands, gardens and yards were flooded. Cattle and poultry were killed. Cracks appeared in walls of the houses and traffic movement was severely affected. Heavy rain also significantly affected eastern part of Georgia, as well: seven villages of Dusheti municipality were isolated from the outside world and more than 20 villages were severely affected. The amount of inflicted damage is being assessed.  Based on the initial needs assessed and on the official request for support for Zugdidi municipality, Senaki town in Samegrelo region and Dusheti municipality in Mtskheta-Mtianeti region GRCS is planning to assist 13 villages (250 families) in Zugdidi Municipality, 300 families in Senaki town and 7 villages (130 families) in Dusheti Municipality.  The Georgia Red Cross Society is now aiming to assist 680 families (3,400 beneficiaries) with food and non-food items (NFI), i.e. food parcels, mattresses, blankets, kitchen sets, and hygiene kits. This operation is expected to be implemented over three months, and will therefore be completed by 1 November 2013; the Final Report will be made available three months after the end of the operation (by 1 February 2014).\n",

Reuters witnesses said the blaze had damaged at least three homes at a hamlet by the town of Marathon - the site of the historic 490 BC battle between Athenians and Persians about 40 kilometres (25 miles) northeast of the Greek capital.  \"The flames have reached homes, but we don't know yet how many are threatened,\" said a fire brigade official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  About 50-60 people were evacuated from their holiday homes in the area, according to a police official. Live television footage showed a thick cloud of black smoke billowing into the air as the fire consumed low vegetation.  More than 60 firefighters and volunteers, supported by dozens of fire engines, four aircraft and four helicopters, battled flames that spread on several fronts. The fire brigade said it would reinforce the teams on the ground.  Summer wildfires are frequent in Greece, often sparked by soaring temperatures, gale force winds, drought, accidents or arson. Greece's worst wildfires in living memory in 2007 killed 65 people over 10 days.  (Reporting by Yannis Behrakis, writing by Renee Maltezou; editing by Mike Collett-White)\n",

      "The estimate is a composite of figures reported by the government of Georgia, UNHCR, and the UN Inter-Agency Humanitarian Assessment Mission to South Ossetia.  The government reported in December 2014 that it had registered 262,704 people as IDPs. This number is based on results from a re-registration exercise conducted in 2013-2014 by the Ministry of IDPs from the Occupied Territories, Accommodation and Refugees. The figure is a slight increase from the initial figure released after the re-registration exercise for two reasons. First, some IDPs failed to participate in the re-registration process in 2013 and consequently had their status terminated. They are now gradually approaching the Ministry in order to re-register and have their statuses restored. Second, children with one IDP parent are entitled to the status. Each month about 400-500 newborns receive the status, which causes an increase in the IDP figure.  Most IDPs were displaced in the early 1990s as a result of conflict in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, while a smaller number were displaced during conflict with the Russian Federation over South Ossetia in August 2008.  The number of IDPs registered by the government includes people who have returned home to Abkhazia, but does not include people displaced within Abkhazia and South Ossetia. No official survey has been conducted there by the Georgian authorities as these regions are not under its control.  The IDMC estimate of 232,700 internally displaced is arrived at by:  deducting from the official government figure of 262,704  At least 45,000 IDPs who have spontaneously returned to Abkhazia (UNHCR, 31 July 2009)  and adding:  Some 5,000 IDPs still displaced within South Ossetia as a result of the 1991-1992 conflict (UN HRC, 14 January 2010)  At least 10,000 IDPs in South Ossetia displaced due to the 2008 conflict (United Nations Inter-agency Humanitarian Assessment Mission to South Ossetia, 2008).  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it.\n",

      "Last update: February 5, 2014 at 5:11 pm by By  Earthquake-report.com is a independent NGO website who only survives because of (mostly small) PRIVATE DONATIONS. Your gift will be highly appreciated. This page will automatically refresh every 30 minutes as we might be adding updates (mostly, but not exclusively for earthquakes with a damaging potential). Keep it open in a browser tab.  –  Update February 5 :  A scientific team, including 100 engineers along with seismologists and engineers from the Technical Chamber of Greece, have already come to the island to inspect all public buildings. According to first estimates, around 600 buildings are deemed demolished, 1,100 heavy damaged and 1,400 with minor damage throughout the region of Palliki while there are several problems in public infrastructure such as roads, ports and public buildings that need restoration.  Update Jan. 27, 10:33 UTC: Seven people suffered minor injuries due to falling objects, officials said. More than 2000 people (temporarily) had to leave their damaged houses.  Update 19:20 UTC: The strong aftershock was also felt in parts of Albania (Tirana) and Italy. A second quake, M 4.2, followed at 19:12 UTC.  Update 19:12 UTC: The revised data from greek authorities say the aftershock had M 5.2. Stong enough to cause new damage and make the night even more uncomfortable. Another shock, M 4.2, followed 15 minutes later. (More Info about the aftershock here)  Update 19:09 UTC: News from the mainshock: At least 2 people are confirmed to be slightly injured. They went to the hospital in Argostoli. Due to the damage caused to tis hospital, mainly to its roof, it was decided to evacuate it. Patients were transferred to the next wooden building.  Update 18:56 UTC: The new quake (aftershock), happening at 18:45 UTC, is specified with Magnitude 4.9 by greek authorities (preliminary data).  Update 18:48 UTC: A new quake, preliminary M 5.6, happened a few minutes ago!  Update 17:59 UTC: Schools across Cephalonia will be closed Monday in order for the necessary verifications of the building structures to be made.  Update 16:59 UTC: Nearly every building in Lixouri suffered at least minor damage. Many buildings, esspecially pubic buildings like schools, show severe damage like collapsed walls and roofs. Other places on Cephalonia, for example the airport, are also affected. Authorities are working to organize a save supply of food and water for the earthquake victims. Most of them won't return to their homes and stay outside during the coming night.  Update 16:48 UTC: Some people are treated in the hospital of Argostoli for minor injuries, mainly caused by falling objects / debris and broken glass.  Update 15:44 UTC: One house in Kounopetra collapsed, luckily without affecting people. An relatively large ash emission of the volcano Etna on Sicily (Italy) followed shortly after this quake was felt there. A connection of both events is possible.  Update 15:18 UTC: Also the neighbour island Zakynthos (south of Cephalonia) reports minor damage to buildings, mainly broken windows.  Update 15:04 UTC: The greek Secretary of Interior is going to visit the earthquake area later today. Newspapers report that Lixouri is the most affected area. Many houses there suffered damage in diverse extent. No injuries or collapsed houses so far, but the quake also caused rockfalls and minor landslides in parts of the island!  Update 14:53 UTC: Power supply is interrupted in Fiskardo, located in northern Cephalonia. More damage reports coming in from different parts of the Island, so far \"only\" bricks falling from walls, cracks and other limited damage, but it seems that several buildings are affected. In Lixouri a hospice and some homes were demolished.  Update 14:48 UTC: Damaged buildings are reported from Lixouri, located only 6 km from the epicenter. No details about the damage are available yet.  Update 14:37 UTC: First reports mentioning cracked roads and a chaotic situation on Cephalonia. Most people were frightened by the earthquake and ran to the streets. Fire brigade and police are checking for possible damaged buildings and injuries.  Update 14:33 UTC: So far, 2 aftershocks with M 4.1 and 4.2 were registered. More are expected to follow. People on Cephalonia should be prepared for it. Residents of Kefalonia are scared. This event reminded them about the great earthquake of 1953 (M 7.2), where hundreds of people lost their lives.  Update 14:29 UTC: The magnitude was revised to 5.8. A shallow depth of only 17 km is given by greek authorities. Quakes with this magnitude and shallow depth happening in populated locations can cause heavy damage, esspecially to buildings with poor construction.  Update 14:21 UTC: People report the shaking also from distant countries, like Albania, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Southern Italy.  A strong quake with magnitude 5.7 shook the greek island Cephalonia a few minutes ago. The shocks were also felt in Athens. The epicenter is located in the western part of the island. We expect some damage caused by this earthquake.

      "le vendredi 03 mai 2013, 22:43 - ECONOMIE - Lien permanent  Alors que la situation revient à la normale en Rhône-Alpes, 250 personnes restent évacuées en Côte-d'Or, onze départements restent en vigilance orange et le risque de crues est important en Haute-Marne. La situation se stabilise  Environ 250 personnes ont été évacuées \"à titre préventif\" près du lac de Pont-et-Massene, qui menaçait de déborder. L'eau du Lac de Pont-et-Massène, régulé par un barrage, montait de 3 centimètres toutes les quinze minutes, vendredi. 250 habitants de Semur-en-Auxois, Genay, Pont-et-Massene, Millery et Saint-Euphrone en aval du lacont été évacuées.  Les personnes evacuées ont été relogées soit dans leur famille soit chez des amis. Le débit de l'eau qui est en moyenne de 17 m3 est monté à 80 m3.    Des habitants de deux rues de Dijon ont été évacués tard vendredi soir, suite à la montée des eaux de l'Ouche, ainsi que des riverains de neuf communes environnantes. Les secours ont ajouté avoir procédé au sauvetage de trois personnes pris dans leur voiture du fait de la montée des eaux de l'Ouche.    Suite à une montée très rapide des eaux de cette rivière, le préfet de Côte-d'Or a procédé à l'alerte de l'ensemble des maires des 21 communes du bassin versant, explique la préfecture dans un communiqué. Les évacuations, \"ciblées\", concernent les habitations les plus exposées.  Manuel Valls suit avec la plus grande attention l'évolution de la situation en Côte d'Or\", a fait savoir le ministère de l'Intérieur. \"Les moyens de l'Etat et des collectivités territoriales sont pleinement mobilisés pour faire face aux conséquences des intempéries qui touchent l'est de la France\", précisait le communiqué ministériel, ajoutant que \"des unités de la Sécurité civile ont été placées en alerte et sont prêtes à être engagées partout où cela serait nécessaire\".\n",

      "Egypt has complied with international human rights law and has consulted with local residents while combating terrorism in Sinai, Egypt's new cabinet said in a press statement on Tuesday.  The statement, which sums up the efforts of the Egyptian government in Sinai over the past two years, said that residents subject to compulsory evacuation in North Sinai were surveyed to find out their preferred method of compensation.  The cabinet's statement came on the same day Human Rights Watch claimed that \"the mass home demolitions and forced eviction of about 3,200 families in the Sinai Peninsula …violated international law.\"  The US-based rights watchdog said in a report that Egypt can \"certainly protect itself from the insurgency and take action against the insurgents’ supply lines…in a way that does not arbitrarily harm civilians and violate their right to housing and their protections during forced evictions.”  For the past two years, Egypt has been combating a spike in a decade-long Islamist militant insurgency in North Sinai.  As part of its strategy to eliminate terrorism, the government evicted over 1,000 families and destroyed many houses, with the aim of creating a 1km-deep buffer zone along Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip.  Egyptian forces have also been destroying underground tunnels between Gaza and Egypt, which they say are used by militants to smuggle weapons into Egypt.  The cabinet statement added that the majority of the surveyed citizens who were evicted from their homes to create the buffer zone wanted their compensation in the form of cash, while a minority preferred replacement land and housing.  The infrastructure of New Rafah, designed to replace the parts of the city of Rafah which were demolished to create the buffer zone, is currently being completed to absorb all those citizens who want to move there, the statement added.  The statement also said that security forces adhered to “the principle of not opening fire on a potential threat unless the source of threat imminently threatens security forces.\"  Human Rights Watch argued that, based on interviews with North Sinai citizens, Egyptian authorities had \"provided residents with little or no warning of the evictions and no effective way to challenge their eviction, home demolition, or compensation.\"  The Human Rights Watch report also argues that Egypt has failed to use sophisticated tunnel-detecting technology, on which Egyptian personnel have been trained by the United States, in order to find and eliminate tunnels without destroying as many homes and buildings.  Cairo has repeatedly called Human Rights Watch's reports on the post-Morsi situation in Egypt biased.  Short link:  \n",

      "Update: 17:32, 15 October 2014 Wednesday  Floods displace 8,000 Ethiopian families  World Bulletin/News Desk  Some 8,000 families have been displaced by the recent overflowing of Ethiopia's Awash River across the country, the Ministry of Water, Energy and Irrigation said Wednesday.  \"Households are being moved to higher ground and given temporary shelter,\" ministry spokesperson Bizuneh Tolcha told Anadolu Agency, asserting that no casualties had been reported thus far.  \"The Ministry of Defense, UNICEF and other donor organizations are working in collaboration with the ministry in an effort to distribute food aid and other materials to the displaced,\" Tolcha said.  \"Food aid, medicine, canopies and other household utensils are being dropped from the air by Defense Ministry helicopters,\" the spokesperson added.  He went on to note that cotton and sugarcane fields, covering more than 5,200 hectares of land, had also been flooded.  Efforts are currently underway to repair a dike that was breached by the floodwaters, he said, adding that all necessary equipment – including heavy trucks, excavators and bulldozers – had already been dispatched to the area.  Repairing the dike would serve to minimize flood damage in other areas, Tolcha said.  The flooding came in the wake of heavy rainfall, measured at between 45 and 91 millimeters, he added.  The Awash River has its source in the central Ethiopian highlands, West of Addis Ababa, and flows towards the Rift Valley. Its basin covers an area of 110,000 square kilometers in Ethiopia's Oromia, Afar and Amhara regions.\n",

      "A landslide caused by recent heavy rain has prompted disaster management authorities in Guatemala to evacuate over 300.  The landslide occurred during the morning of Saturday, 11 July 2015, in the municipality of Chinautla, in the department of Guatemala. The country’s disaster management agency, CONRED, say that the landslide completely destroyed 10 houses and damaged 11 others. A further 49 homes are thought to be at risk, prompting CONRED to evacuate 350 people in total.  Around 46 of those displaced are currently staying in a local community hall, while the rest have found temporary accommodation with family or friends.  No deaths or injuries have been reported. CONRED have distributed blankets and sleeping mats, hygiene kits and clean water to those affected by the landslide.  More Rain Forecast  Guatemala’s meteorological department INSIVUMEH said that northern areas of the country could see more than 40mm of rain in the next 24 hours. Currently three rivers or lakes in the northern Petén Department are above normal maximum levels: Río La Pasión, Lago Petén Itzá, and Rìo Usumacinta.  INSIVUMEH also warned that further heavy rainfall is likely from Wednesday 15 July, especially in southern and central regions.  Heavy rain across parts of central America over the last 2 weeks has also affected Nicaragua where the Escondido river has overflowed in El Rama, and Costa Rica, where over 1,000 people have been evacuated after over 2 weeks of flooding.\n",

      "Local authorities say that Nicaragua and Honduras have experienced heavy rainfall during the first two weeks of June, causing floods which have left a total of 8 people dead and 2 missing.  Nicaragua  In Nicaragua, the disaster management agency, Sistema Nacional para la Prevención, Mitigación y Atención de Desastres (SINAPRED), say that heavy rain between 02 and 14 June has left 6 people dead, and affected 35,350 in 7,041 households. As of 15 June, there were 129 families displaced by the floods and severe weather, most of them in Managua municipality. The families are currently being housed in shelters or temporary accommodation.  The heavy rain and ensuing floods have affected 11 departments of the country – Managua, Madriz, Carazo, Nueva Segovia, León, Matagalpa, Masaya, Chinandega, Esteli, Granada and the North Caribbean Coast Region.  According to SINAPRED figures, 6,975 homes have been flooded over the last 2 weeks, with at least 22 homes have been completely destroyed, and a further 44 severely damaged. Two schools have been destroyed in the floods, with 10 other schools damaged.  Landslide Warnings  On Monday 15 June, the heavy rain prompted SINAPRED to issue landslide warnings for those living in communities near the volcanoes in the country.  Dr. Guillermo Gonzalez, Co Director SINAPRED, said that the slopes of active volcanoes, including San Cristobal, Telica Momotombo and Concepción, as well as inactive volcanoes such as Casitas, Santa Clara, Mombacho and Maderas, have been made unstable by the heavy rains, increasing the possibility of sudden landslides which could cause damage to crops and infrastructure and the loss of human lives.  Given that such landslides can occur suddenly, Dr. Gonzalez said that it is very difficult to give effective early warnings. He recommended those in vulnerable areas refer to hazard maps produced by Instituto Nicaragüense de Estudios Territoriales (INETER) to assess the conditions of the communities most at risk.  Honduras  Local media in Honduras are reporting that the country has also been badly affected by heavy rain and resulting floods over the last few days.  As of 15 June 2015, at least two people have died and another two are missing, over 500 have been affected and over 115 homes have been damaged. Over 100 people have been displaced by floods in the last few days, most of them in Siguatepeque but also some in Tegucigalpa.\n",

      "UNDP, Government of Haiti provide immediate support to flood-affected victims  Flood-affected areas in the northern city of Cap-Haitien and other neighbouring towns following heavy rains. Photo Credit: MINUSTAH  Port-au-Prince - Haiti’s Department of Civil Protection in partnership with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has been working non-stop to assist flood-affected families in the northern city of Cap-Haitien and other neighbouring towns following heavy rains, floods and landslides that killed 17 people, five of them children. More than 15,000 houses were flooded, 90 were destroyed and 800 were severely damaged. Over 6,500 people are temporarily housed in emergency shelters.  The recent floods have also affected over 2,200 hectares of crops in one of the country’s most fertile areas.  “This hurricane season is nearly over and has been relatively mild in Haiti, but the recent storms have once again showed the country’s vulnerability to natural disasters,” said UNDP Haiti Senior Country Director Sophie de Caen, adding that UNDP and the UN family have been immediately working with the Government to mobilize resources and provide support to the most affected populations.  ”However, these floods actually showed that Haiti is strengthening its disaster prevention capacity: as a result of UNDP’s work to improve Haiti’s Civil Protection Department and its effectiveness, the response to the recent floods was entirely led by national authorities.”  Moreover, around 40 UNDP experts work directly with the Government and its Emergency Operation Centers at the national and local levels.  To mitigate the impact of floods and other natural disasters, UNDP and the Haitian Government have also planted close to nine million trees and worked with farmers to plant more resistant crops that prevent erosion. In addition, flood mitigation measures have been improved, using watershed management tools and protecting riverbanks.  “It is clear that the Government’s recent efforts with its partners—including UNDP—to boost resilience, particularly in the north and northeastern areas, are a step in the right direction,” de Caen said.\n",

      "—Entonces, ¿aquí es donde viven ustedes, los narcotraficantes?  —Aquí mismo, mire usté. Venga, le voy a presentar a toda la gente –me dice Venustiano.  Retira el alambre del palo y deja caer la portezuela. Asoman un viejito minúsculo y arrugado y un hombre recio que termina de bañarse a guacaladas en medio del patio. Morenos, tostados. El viejito dice algo en lengua quekchí, y de las champas comienzan a salir mujeres, muchas mujeres ancianas, y niños, unos 20 niños.  Esto es el departamento de Petén, al norte de Guatemala, los arrabales de un municipio llamado La Libertad. Para llegar hasta aquí hemos dejado atrás el bullicio del mercado, nos hemos alejado de cualquier punto de tuc-tuc, esas motocicletas con carcasa que hacen de taxis, y nos hemos internado por una vereda polvosa y reseca. El predio es del tamaño de media cancha de fútbol, y acoge siete champas desperdigadas, todas de plástico, cartón y palos. En medio del predio hay un charco grisáceo y espeso, con restos de comida. Huele a animal muerto. En una de las champas se cocina el almuerzo sobre un enorme comal. Sobre el comal, el almuerzo: tortillas y más tortillas.  Todas las personas se reúnen alrededor de Venustiano. Están sucias. Los niños, raquíticos y panzones. No dicen nada porque muy pocos pueden hablar castellano. Me ven y esperan.  —¿Ustedes son los narcotraficantes de Centro Uno?  —Nosotros somos –me contesta Venustiano, el líder de los moribundos–, ¿qué le parece?  —No sé qué decirle, Venustiano.  La puerta de oro  Las autoridades de México llaman al estado norteño de Sonora la puerta de oro hacia Estados Unidos. Allí están las rutas antiguas del contrabando, y allí viven y prosperan sin esconderse quienes manejan esos negocios. Bajo esa misma lógica, Petén podría bautizarse como la puerta de oro centroamericana hacia México.  El Informe lo deja bien claro; ya verán.  Petén es el departamento más vasto de Guatemala: más de 35 mil kilómetros cuadrados, una extensión que casi duplica la de El Salvador. Petén comparte 600 kilómetrosde de frontera con México y es un territorio en el que abundan los ríos y las selvas. Las autoridades militares guatemaltecas tienen claro que es el tramo de frontera más problemático del país. La fórmula que aplican es que mientras más se acerque la frontera al Océano Pacífico, más se puede hablar de migrantes, de contrabando de mercaderías, de grupos criminales locales, de prostíbulos de la trata, de machetes y pistolas. En cambio, mientras más se acerque a Petén, más se trata de grupos transnacionales, armas de asalto y vínculos políticos.  Las similitudes entre Petén y Sonora no se limitan a ser la sede principal de las grandes ligas del crimen organizado de los respectivos países; también se parecen por sus características demográficas. Un terreno con zonas solo accesibles por aire o en poderosos vehículos y, por tanto, despobladas. Mientras que Guatemala tiene en promedio 132 habitantes por kilómetro cuadrado, esa cifra en Petén es de apenas 16.  Aquí las extensiones se miden en una medida llamada caballería, que equivale a 64 manzanas o a 45 hectáreas.  La región sur de Petén es una zona, cada vez más, de amplias extensiones privadas donde empresas transnacionales siembran caballerías y caballerías de palma africana. Son una especie de palmeras chicas de las que se obtiene el aceite vegetal que, si bien apenas se consume en Centroamérica, es con el que más se cocina en el mundo entero. Justo en la franja central del departamento, delgada en proporción con el resto, se extiende de sur a norte una tira urbana que en sus extremos laterales se despuebla y deja paso a lo verde e indómito, a las caballerías de familias acusadas de estar vinculadas con el crimen organizado hasta por el propio Álvaro Colom, el presidente de la República. Y en la parte alta, una franja –menos gruesa que la de palma africana pero más que la urbana– que está repleta de reservas forestales protegidas donde no se puede deforestar sin permisos especiales. Al menos eso es lo que dice la ley. Petén está despoblado porque en su mayoría o es privado o restringido para el cultivo y la construcción.  Ese cariz privado y latifundista de las tierras peteneras responde no solo a las reservas protegidas, sino también a la acumulación de caballerías por parte de las grandes empresas de palma africana y de los grupos criminales. Así se dice en el Informe.  Todo este entramado complejo es el que ha llevado a Venustiano y su gente a vivir en champas que circundan un charco que huele a animal muerto y aún así ser etiquetados como narcotraficantes.  Vos o tu viuda  Los que saben cómo funciona este lugar parecen estar convencidos de que hay ojos y orejas por todas partes. Antes de subir a Petén, pasé una semana para amarrar fuentes confiables que me recibieran. Desde ciudad de Guatemala conversé con cinco personas que viven o vivieron aquí. Conseguí un contacto de unos religiosos que me pidieron que bajo ninguna condición se me ocurriera visitarlos en Petén. Pero ese contacto aceptó hablar con la premisa de detalles a cambio de anonimato.  La cita es hoy. Nos reunimos en Santa Elena, el más poblado de los municipios de la franja urbana, en una oficina donde un potente ventilador nos salva del pesado calor y de los mosquitos. Él es un respetado activista que trabaja en coordinación con decenas de organizaciones de la sociedad civil.  Por estos días, los medios de alcance nacional hablan de Petén en sus portadas por una única razón. Allá en el Parque Nacional Sierra del Lacandón, en la frontera con México, acaba de ser desalojada una comunidad de campesinos que usurpaba esos terrenos supuestamente prohibidos para los humanos. En las notas, el ministro de Gobernación, Carlos Menocal, relaciona el desalojo con el narco, y los medios televisivos celebran el duro golpe al narcotráfico de la zona que se ha dado al retirar a esas 300 familias que trabajaban para los apellidos renombrados por estos lares.  —Otra vez desalojaron a los narcos –dice el hombre con el que hablo, y se echa a reír.  Le pregunto el porqué de la risa.  —Con lo que se teje por acá, tener el descaro de decir que ellos son… En fin. De aquí todos los periodistas se van creyendo que contaron algo sobre el narco, y apenas han hablado de un grupo de campesinos pobres. Gente que ha perdido sus tierras, muchos a los que se las han arrebatado y que se van buscando dónde diablos cosechar su maíz, su frijol, sus pepitas. Y cuando encuentran un lugar allá perdido los acusan de narcos, los desalojan y los dejan tirados en cualquier parte, mendigando.  —Pero ellos invaden tierras prohibidas –hago de abogado del diablo.  —Y usted y yo lo haríamos. ¿No le digo que no tienen dónde cultivar, pues? ¿Y si solo eso saben hacer? Claro, si usted no tiene nada, si sabe que pronto le quitarán su siembra y su tierra y un señor le dice que por 1,500 quetzales (unos 190 dólares) descargue o cargue una avioneta, ¿qué haría?  Sobra la respuesta.  —No son poquitos los hijos que tiene un campesino –dice el activista, y ríe de nuevo.  Le digo que quiero hablar con ellos, con los campesinos, los supuestos narcotraficantes. Vuelve a reír. Lo hace como con hartazgo, como quejándose de mi ingenuidad. Dice que para ir a hablar con los que ocupan tierras, hay que meterse en terrenos demasiado vigilados por el crimen organizado. Además, dice, no sé si le hablarán, están hartos de que los periodistas los busquen con la misma pregunta: ¿ustedes trabajan para el narco? Dice que lo mejor es hablar con comunidades ya desalojadas.  En 1959 inició un plan para poblar Petén, para integrarlo en el país y para explotar su potencial agrícola. Se entregaron tierras a grandes empresarios, pero también a pequeños campesinos que podían cultivar.  —Sí –dice el activista–, y durante un tiempo los campesinos cultivaron sus cosechas y se las comieron y vivieron de eso. Vinieron de todas partes del país, pero hablamos de mediados del siglo pasado. No había carreteras buenas y no interesaba tanto acumular tierra. Muchos empresarios tenían grandes propiedades, pero no las ocupaban.  —¿Y qué cambió?  —Que hoy dos carreteras comunican Petén con el país, y que desde el año 2000 se vino con fuerza la palma africana, y los árboles maderables, teca y melina, y entonces la parcelita del campesino se volvió interesante para muchos. Ah, claro, y el acceso fácil por tierra a Petén hizo que narcotraficantes y contrabandistas y otros señores se interesaran más por acumular tierras fronterizas con México.  —En todo caso, lo que me dice es que los campesinos vendieron sus tierras.  —Hay formas y formas de vender. Le explico: si un abogado de una empresa lo visita una y otra vez hablándole de sumas de cinco números, y usted es un campesino quekchí, le brillan los ojos y vende sin saber nada. Si usted es un campesino, indígena o no, y los narcos quieren su tierra, entonces está más jodido, porque solo le avisarán que usted va a vender a una cantidad, y punto.  —¿Y si uno se niega?  —Hubo una frase famosa aquí a principios de la década: si vos no querés vender, tu viuda va a vender barato.  Este activista sabe de lo que habla. Recibe cada mes a decenas de campesinos que han sido presionados para vender, y asesora a los que no les pagan lo acordado o simplemente no entienden lo que dice su contrato de venta, porque no leyeron la letra chica o porque no saben leer.  El meollo del discurso de este activista se puede resumir en un Estado que ocupa dos varas para castigar: es implacable con los débiles, aparenta con ellos que es un Estado fuerte, y deja en paz a los verdaderos rivales de peso.  —Guatemala recibe fondos privados y de organismos internacionales para la protección de reservas y zonas arqueológicas. ¿Dónde muestra fuerza el Estado para aparentar ante esos donantes? Con los más débiles, a los que además acusa de narcotraficantes, lo que lo hace quedar mejor aun.  El activista vuelve a reír fuerte y con sarcasmo.  —Mire, nosotros nos metemos en esa zona, hablamos con esos campesinos y sabemos perfectamente que familias renombradas de narcotraficantes como los Mendoza, los León y los Lorenzana tienen grandes extensiones en reservas protegidas como los parques nacionales Sierra del Lacandón y Laguna del Tigre.  Y eso no solo él lo sabe. Incluso informes gubernamentales confirman que, parafraseando lo que en su día dijo monseñor Óscar Arnulfo Romero, las leyes en Petén son como las serpientes, que solo muerden a los que caminan descalzos. El Informe también lo explicita.  Los militares y el Informe  El viento sopla con fuerza en este café de la Zona18 de ciudad de Guatemala. Alrededor revolotean las servilletas que el chiflón arrebata a las mesas vacías. Desde esta terraza se ve los tejados de las casas de varias colonias de la clase media-baja. A pesar del frío, escogimos sentarnos aquí por privilegiar el aislamiento.  El coronel Díaz Santos pide un té negro. Lo conocí a principios de año, cuando era el segundo al mando de los militares en el estado de sitio con el que el presidente guatemalteco intentó frenar la entrada de Los Zetas a Alta Verapaz, el departamento ubicado al sur de Petén. El coronel ahora es el encargado de la Fuerzade Tarea Norte de Petén, que cubre Sayaxché, el municipio por excelencia de la palma africana y del trasiego de droga por el río La Pasión, rodeado por caballerías de las renombradas familias chapinas del narco. También se encarga del suroeste petenero, que cubre parte de La Libertad, cuando la franja urbana se diluye mientras más se acerca a México, y deja paso a las reservas. Allá se encuentra El Naranjo, un pueblo fronterizo al que, echando mano de un desfasado estereotipo, los mismos militares llaman la Tijuana guatemalteca: trasiego de drogas y otras mercancías, trata, migración indocumentada.  Cuando conversamos la primera vez, lo hicimos en el cuartel general de Cobán, la cabecera departamental de Alta Verapaz. Él vestía uniforme y hablaba con desenvolvimiento de Los Zetas y de las familias locales vinculadas al narcotráfico. Ahora, de civil y en su día libre, es más mesurado para referirse a Petén. Hay que arrancarle los dobles sentidos a algunas de sus respuestas.  El coronel conoce bien la zona donde ocurrió el último desalojo de 300 campesinos. Estuvo de hecho en ese operativo. Recalca una y otra vez que cumplían órdenes del Ministerio Público, que fueron a sacar a gente asentada en zona prohibida, que encontraron gente humilde: mujeres, muchas mujeres ancianas, y niños. Dice que a él nunca le dijeron nada acerca de narcotraficantes.  Le hago ver que tanto el ministro de Gobernación como el mismo comunicado oficial del gobierno dijeron que se trataba de personas vinculadas al narco. Sin matices. “Áreas en poder del narcotráfico”, calificaron ese asentamiento campesino. El coronel se reserva su opinión. De cualquier modo, es un despropósito seguir preguntando por el tema. Es absurdo, el gobierno mismo se contradice. Desalojar a unos narcotraficantes por usurpar un área natural protegida sería como arrestar a un asesino por robar el teléfono a quien acaba de matar.  El coronel medita un instante, sorbe té, aclara que no va a opinar sobre la postura de Menocal, que él puede dar su opinión. Lo interrumpo y le pregunto si cuando acompañó el desalojo en La Libertad creyó que estaba sacando narcotraficantes.  —No. Pienso que no se puede descartar que más de algún campesino esté involucrado, pero no se puede generalizar. Muchos se ven forzados a buscar las áreas protegidas. Venden sus terrenos para que sean tomados por la gente que cultiva palma africana… ¿Y para dónde agarran? La única zona que queda para cultivar es el área protegida.  —Usted conoce la zona, coronel. Se dice que hay extensiones enormes de tierra que pertenecen de facto a los Mendoza, a los Lorenzana, a veces a través de testaferros.  —La gente señala unas extensiones de terreno como de una familia, de otra familia, pero a ciencia cierta no se puede saber porque no hay nadie que alegue el registro.  —¿Usted cree que hay gente realmente poderosa que tiene tierras en áreas protegidas?  —Pienso que sí.  —¿Grupos que las ocupan para trasiego de drogas, maderas y contrabando…?  —Pienso que sí.  Existe un informe con datos gubernamentales que habla de que algunos de estos terrenos están registrados legalmente. Incluso algunos altos mandos militares como el general Eduardo Morales, que coordinó la instalación este año del estado de sitio en Petén, consideran que la zona norte del departamento, repleta de áreas protegidas como Laguna del Tigre, está atestada de grandes extensiones de los capos que coordinan aterrizajes constantes de avionetas que luego queman, para no dejar pistas. Morales incluso me habló hace unos días de depredación descarada de la naturaleza para construir pistas y cementerios de avionetas. Me habló de un hotel con capacidad para 100 personas en Sierra del Lacandón, y de un aterrizaje reciente en Laguna del Tigre donde un oficial y dos soldados se enfrentaron a unos 40 hombres armados que los obligaron a huir. “Es triste reconocerlo –dijo–, pero es así”.  Le digo al coronel Díaz Santos que me parece muy raro que el Consejo Nacional de Áreas Protegidas (Conap) no se entere de esto, pero sí de los asentamientos campesinos; que la Policía, que apoya en la vigilancia al Conap, tampoco se entere. Le pregunto si él confía en esas autoridades.  —¡Uf! Me reservo la respuesta.  —Coronel, y ya que hablamos del Informe que ha estado dando vueltas en todo Petén, ¿usted le da credibilidad?  —Le voy a contestar con el comentario que me hizo un amigo. Para lo que sirve el Informe es para ser cauto de lo que uno tiene que hablar y de con quién tiene que hablar.  El Informe se titula “Grupos de poder en Petén: territorio, política y negocios”, salió a luz pública en julio de este año y fue financiado por el organismo internacional Soros Foundation. Un resumen fue publicado por el portal Insight Crime, consultado por la cúpula política de Washington. A escala nacional, fue retomado por medios guatemaltecos como El Periódico y Plaza Pública. En Petén ningún medio local se hizo eco, pero no hubo una persona, fuera activista, funcionario o militar, con la que conversara durante mi viaje, que no lo hubiera leído. Ha circulado de mano en mano, de boca en boca, de e-mail en e-mail.  Los autores, investigadores de diferentes países, de diferentes especialidades, no firmaron el Informe. Es anónimo. Ellos no han dado declaraciones en ningún medio. Temen por sus vidas y no quieren que nadie sepa ni siquiera de qué nacionalidad son o en qué país viven. Luego de varios intermediarios, conseguí que dos de ellos accedieran a conversar vía skype. El Informe es muy explícito, rico en fuentes oficiales. Toda su información sobre propiedades está sustentada con datos del catastro; el resto, con datos oficiales, informes internacionales, declaraciones de funcionarios publicadas en medios de comunicación y entrevistas con informantes claves en Petén.  En las conversaciones vía skype me dijeron que no publicaron sus nombres porque los poderosos de los que hablan tienen influencias incluso a nivel internacional. Me aseguraron que fueron recatados. “Publicamos solo lo que pudimos comprobar, aunque hay muchas propiedades no registradas en áreas protegidas que de facto pertenecen a grupos del crimen organizado”, explicó uno.  El Informe no deja títere con cabeza. Petén aparece dibujado como tierra fértil para la corrupción política, el trasiego de drogas y la concentración de tierras y poder en muy pocas manos. Petén no es tierra para gente humilde.  En la evaluación que se hace de los partidos políticos, las conclusiones son escandalosas: a las candidaturas ganadoras para alcaldías o diputaciones distritales solo se llega si se tienen nexos políticos con el crimen organizado o si directamente se forma parte de alguna estructura criminal. El Informe señala con nombres y apellidos personas en todos los partidos, sin excepción, que serían las encargadas de realizar esas alianzas.  Las acusaciones llegan hasta el más alto nivel. Sobre el candidato presidencial del partido Líder, Manuel Baldizón, quien es originario de Petén, se dice que su familia consiguió su poder económico en gran parte gracias al contrabando de piezas arqueológicas. El Informe remite a testimonios anónimos de las personas que participaron en grupos de saqueo de ruinas mayas: extraían piezas para luego venderlas a coleccionistas extranjeros.  El Informe también explica cómo familias que desde hace décadas se dedican al crimen organizado, como los Mendoza, originarios del estratégico departamento de Izabal, fronterizo con Honduras y Belice, se han apropiado de enormes fincas en Petén desde hace mucho tiempo. Los Mendoza poseen 23 fincas dispersas en cuatro municipios peteneros. La extensión de esas fincas suma 660 caballerías. Muchas de las propiedades están en las riberas del río La Pasión, y al menos una de ellas tiene una mansión con piscina y pista de aterrizaje.  Ninguna autoridad desaloja o señala en voz alta a estos terratenientes. El Informe explica que la mayor extensión de tierras, 250 caballerías que los Mendoza poseen a su nombre y a nombre de testaferros, se encuentra en gran parte dentro de la reserva Sierra del Lacandón, el parque nacional del que fueron corridos los 300 campesinos del último desalojo, muchos de los que, sin otro lugar al que ir, se retiraron a la selva del lado mexicano. Tanto el coronel como el general apuntan a que no se trata solo de que en esas zonas las familias del crimen organizado invaden terrenos que no les pertenecen, sino que en sus rutinas mafiosas se apropian para establecer sus cinturones de tenencia de tierra que les permitan hacer sus trasiegos. Incluso el general Morales asegura que Los Zetas tienen bases de entrenamiento y descanso en Laguna del Tigre.  No se trata de actividades discretas. El general Morales recuerda cómo hace unos tres años encontraron en la ribera del río San Pedro, entre Laguna del Tigre y Sierra del Lacandón, bodegas enormes de almacenaje e incluso un barco en construcción. “Un barco grande, como para llevar carros. Uno de los fiscales dijo que parecía el Arca de Noé”, recuerda el general.  Esas fincas tienen conexión entre sí hasta llegar a la frontera natural con México, el río Usumacinta. “En cada una de las fincas –dice una de las personas entrevistadas para el Informe– tienen grupos armados”.  Petén se ha convertido en una especie de condominio de las grandes familias del crimen organizado de Guatemala. Entre los apellidos que el propio presidente Colom ha relacionado con el narcotráfico, Mendoza no es el único con fuerte presencia en el departamento. Los León, originarios de Zacapa -también frontera con Honduras-, tienen en Petén 316 caballerías; “en puntos estratégicos de las rutas de la droga”, explicita el Informe. Los Lorenzana, también de Zacapa, tenían incluso cuatro fincas en el área protegida de Laguna del Tigre. Una de las fincas, en un sinsentido del sistema, estaba inscrita en el Registro de Propiedad a nombre del patriarca Waldemar Lorenzana, extraditado este año a Estados Unidos bajo cargos de narcotráfico.  El Informe concluye que las propiedades relacionadas con los grupos criminales alcanzan una cifra de cuatro dígitos: 1 mil 179 caballerías. O sea, siete veces la superficie de la ciudad de San Salvador. Las empresas de palma africana tienen en registro oficial 1 mil 27 caballerías. Eso significa que al menos 10.5% de la tierra que el Estado cataloga como cultivable en Petén está fuera del alcance de un campesino común, así tuviera el dinero para comprar.  A cambio de eso, y según el Conap, para el año 2007, solo en el municipio de Sayaxché, casi 8 mil personas habían sido desplazadas de 902 caballerías. Eso eran 27 comunidades campesinas que dieron paso a las empresas de palma africana o a otros compradores. Lo que nadie dice es que los campesinos, que muchas veces se quedan sin opción cuando los narcos quieren sus tierras, también deben bregar con la insistencia de compra de las empresas transnacionales, que en ocasiones presionan para conseguir lo que quieren: más tierra.  Susurros en quekchí  Son las 6 de la mañana, y los rayos del sol son débiles, reconfortantes. Voy en un autobús que de El Subín, cerca de Sayaxché, trepa hacia el norte petenero, hacia Santa Elena. El vehículo no va lleno, y en la parte de atrás solo viajan dos personas más. Uno, según entiendo, es campesino, y hace preguntas al otro, que es obrero de la construcción. Van delante de mí y resulta obvio que no les importa ser escuchados.  El campesino pregunta al obrero si hay trabajo en su rama. El obrero le dice que sí, que en la zona de Santa Elena se están levantando buenas construcciones. El campesino le contesta que tiene suerte, que no son tiempos de trabajar la tierra, que “si vos tenés una buena tierra, te la quitan”, que ya solo van quedando “tierras secas, muertas”. Le dice también que allá abajo, por Sayaxché, solo queda trabajar para las empresas de palma africana, porque “los señores que tienen tierras buenas no quieren trabajadores para trabajar la tierra”.  Ya en Santa Elena me recibe Alfredo Che, un campesino recio, compacto, con ese castellano cortado y lento de los quekchí. Él es de la directiva de la Asociación de Comunidades Campesinas Indígenas para el Desarrollo Integral de Petén, que a su vez forma parte de la Coordinadora Nacional de Organizaciones Campesinas. Su red de contactos es enorme, y una de sus principales reivindicaciones es que se negocie con las comunidades que han sido desalojadas de reservas naturales. Piden que, a falta de opción para conseguir otras zonas para cultivar, se les permita regresar condicionados a no expandirse y a cultivar bajo normas que respeten el ecosistema.  Che habla con rabia, se le nota en el gesto, pero la voz nunca deja de ser un susurro. Se queja de que en Petén hasta los asesinatos de campesinos son un argumento contra los campesinos. En mayo de 2011, en una finca llamada Los Cocos, en la zona despoblada de La Libertad, hubo una sonora masacre de 27 personas. Según las autoridades, fue perpetrada por Los Zetas. También dijeron que el ataque iba dirigido contra el dueño de la finca, pero que como no lo encontraron, se desquitaron con los campesinos. A algunos los decapitaron con motosierras. En unas fotografías que me mostró un investigador que estuvo en la escena aparecen cadáveres con las botas de trabajo puestas.  Incluso el Ministerio de Gobernación aseguró que los cadáveres eran de campesinos que realizaban labores agrícolas en la finca, pero Che dice que las autoridades peteneras se agarran a casos como este para argumentar en las negociaciones con su organización que los campesinos colaboran con las “narcofincas” y que por eso los matan. Para Che, aun si eso fuera cierto, los desalojos siguen aplicándose siempre a los mismos, a los que se parecen a Venustiano.  —Es que no desalojan a los finqueros, sino a los campesinos que están fuera de las fincas, a las comunidades que cultivan lo que se comen. Le dirán que es verde por ahí, pero lo real es que al caminar el parque Sierra del Lacandón, la Biosfera Maya, ya no se ven montañas vírgenes. La Conap tiene guardas, pero no pueden hacer nada, andan una pistolita .38, y la Unidad de Protección de la Naturaleza... Dos policías más tres guardas no pueden enfrentarse con un grupo armado con armas de asalto. A lo mejor los mira y les dice adiós. Están atacando a las comunidades indefensas, pero a los finqueros no les hacen nada.  No son solo voces de la sociedad civil las que denuncian estas contradicciones entre poderosos y humildes. Francisco Dall’Anesse, el fiscal al mando de la Comisión Internacional Contrala Impunidad en Guatemala (CICIG) instalada por Naciones Unidas en 2006, dedicó unas palabras a este desbalance durante un discurso que pronunció el 4 de septiembre en un encuentro de periodistas en Argentina. Dijo que en Petén “hay grupos de indígenas tirados a la calle de sus terrenos”, mientras que contra los verdaderos narcos nadie hace nada, y contó la anécdota de cómo cuando un alto comisionado de Naciones Unidas iba hacia el rancho Los Cocos a presenciar la escena del descuartizamiento de los 27 campesinos, lo pararon narcos armados hasta los dientes para preguntarle hacia dónde iba, y lo obligaron a identificarse para dejarlo en paz.  Che asegura que, ya sea bajo amenaza de los narcos o por presiones de las empresas de palma africana, por una caballería que puede valer 200 mil quetzales (25 mil 500 dólares) se reciben con suerte 50 mil. Le pregunto por qué no denuncian. Contesta que ya lo han hecho muchas veces, pero el resultado es un trámite burocrático que termina engavetado en alguna delegación del Ministerio Público en el mejor de los casos.  Le pregunto por esa otra modalidad de sacar a los campesinos de su tierra, la que ocupan las empresas, y me dice que hay coyotes, que es como llaman por estos lados a los negociadores contratados por las empresas, gente de las mismas comunidades muchas veces. Los envían para insistir a los campesinos, una y otra vez, hasta que ceden y firman contratos que no comprenden. Me dice que lo mejor es que para entender eso hable con otro miembro de su asociación, con Domingo Choc, quien se encarga del municipio más codiciado por las transnacionales de palma africana, Sayaxché.  Por la tarde aparece Choc. Las empresas son inteligentes, dice, saben meter miedo en las comunidades.  La amenaza consiste en presionar y dividir. “Si un coyote no lo logra enviarán a otro más pilas, hasta que lo consiga”, explica. Insisten una y otra vez hasta que dividen a la comunidad y se quedan con los últimos a los que amenazan con dejarlos encerrados dentro de la parcela de palma africana. Y una vez ocurre eso, los guardias privados no permiten que esos campesinos que se quedan encerrados entre palma africana pasen por las tierras de la empresa, no dejan que metan vehículos para sacar sus sacos de maíz, de frijol y venderlos en la calle. Los condenan a cosechar para comer y nada más. Así van logrando que esos mismos renuentes vendan y se conviertan en trabajadores de la finca a los que suelen mantener sin contrato, por jornal, o sea, a los que les pagan menos de los 63.70 quetzales diarios (ocho dólares) por día de trabajo que la ley estipula como salario mínimo. Y así hasta que los campesinos se hartan de sudar por una miseria la tierra que antes era de ellos, y se largan como Venustiano a una zona protegida, esperando no ser desalojados y exponiéndose a ser acusados de narcotraficantes.  A José Cacxoj, un campesino de Sayaxché que conocí en este viaje, le ocurrió eso. A sus 63 años se hartó de recibir cada día la visita de un tal ingeniero Gustavo que le invitaba a vender su parcela en la aldea Las Camelias antes de quedarse encerrado entre palma africana. Vendió por 100 mil quetzales su parcela que no llegaba ni a la mitad de una caballería. Hace dos años que busca una parcela en otras tierras del departamento que no le interesen a los narcos ni a las empresas de palma, pero no la encuentra, porque la manzana cuesta el doble de lo que a él le pagaron. Así que Cacxoj está dilapidando su dinero alquilando parcelas bajo el trato de que de lo que cultive tiene que dar la mitad al propietario. Si una de las dos cosechas anuales se cae, como le sucedió el año pasado que llovió poco, Cacxoj se arruina. Ahora anda pensando en ocupar lo poco que le queda para largarse a invadir tierras protegidas, para convertirse en un invasor, como llaman el Estado y los grupos de poder a esos campesinos, para convertirse en narcotraficantes, como llamaron a Venustiano y a su comunidad.  Pregunto a Choc qué tan extensa es la lista de comunidades desalojadas. Me contesta que no sabe decirme en número de personas, sino en comunidades con nombres y familias.  —Está la comunidad El Progreso, en Sayaxché; se terminó, 23 familias. La comunidad El Cubil, 32 familias, terminada, ya no existe. El Canaleño, 46 familias. La Torre, mi comunidad, 76 familias. Santa Rosa, 86 familias. Arroyo Santa María, 43 familias…Y la que todos recuerdan como la primera comunidad, Centro Uno, 164 familias, terminada, ya no existe.  Venustiano y Centro Uno  Ha pasado un día desde que me junté con Che y Choc. Ellos fueron quienes me ayudaron a contactar a campesinos de Centro Uno. Es un mediodía ardiente y húmedo. El autobús que va hacia La Libertad, donde nos encontraremos, lleva las ventanas abiertas, cruza por varios tramos estropeados de la carretera donde el polvo se instala en la piel sudada y parece atraer nubes de minúsculos mosquitos que revolotean en la cara.  El centro del municipio es un mercado callejero. Los tuc tuc se mueven con rapidez entre la gente y sorprendentemente no atropellan a ningún peatón. Cada negocio tiene un altavoz con música norteña o un megáfono desde el que un dependiente grita las promociones. Entro en una pollería, y desde el traspatio donde lavan los trastos en una pila, llamo a Venustiano, que me dice que ubica el lugar, que espere ahí mismo, que llegará con Santos, otro ex habitante de Centro Uno.  Venustiano, a sus 56 años, es un campesino prototipo. Fibroso, de bigote, con una raída camiseta blanca, un jeans y botas negras de trabajo. Con esa piel en el rostro que, en miniatura, tiene grietas como las de la tierra del campo que seca después de la lluvia. Lo acompaña Santos, un recio y lampiño indígena quekchí.  Ambos hablan con un tono a medio camino entre la pena y el agradecimiento. Parece que no están acostumbrados a contar su historia. Cuando ocurrió el desalojo de Centro Uno en 2009, los medios solo recogieron la versión oficial. Dice Venustiano que a él nunca nadie le preguntó nada. Venustiano habla sobre un lugar infértil, de plásticos, maderos y champas, de la economía de la miseria, de días en que trabaja ocho horas en parcelas ajenas, lejos de su improvisada casa, de ganar 30 quetzales por jornada, de que “al sembrar en lo ajeno ni la semilla pepena”. Lo interrumpo para pedirle que empiece por el principio, que me cuente cómo era Centro Uno allá en Sierra del Lacandón. “¿Cómo era?”, pregunta, deja el pollo asado que comemos sobre el plato, se limpia la grasa del bigote y espanta el nubarrón de mosquitos de su cara con un manotazo lento. Hace una pausa y pone los ojos del que recuerda, tornados hacia la nada.  —Donde vivíamos teníamos agua, un arroyo, tierra. El arroyo era limpio, se miraban bien los pies. Había una vaquería donde uno se enlodaba para entrar, pero al pasarla, aquello era lindo, había maíz, frijol y éramos felices. Había palos de coco, de aguacate, palos cargadores todos, naranjas, limón, mango cargador, así, ve –estira la mano semiabierta hacia arriba–. Uno conoce sus tierras. Caña también, yuca, y guineo, macal, o malanga que le llaman, uno se sentía feliz de la vida.  A las 10 de la mañana del 16 de junio de 2009, un contingente de unos 600 militares, policías, guardias forestales, autoridades del Ministerio Público y funcionarios de la Procuraduríade para la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos (PDDH) inauguraron con la comunidad Centro Uno una modalidad de desalojos masivos de campesinos en Petén. 164 familias fueron removidas de la comunidad que, por unos pocos, y sin permiso, había sido creada antes de que se firmara la paz en 1996. Unos llegaron antes, allá por 1992. El grueso, familiares de los pioneros, llegó en los siguientes cinco años, casi todos campesinos de Ixcán, Izabal, Quiché y Cobán que habían deambulado buscando dónde instalarse para cultivar la tierra lejos de la guerra.  Centro Uno nunca fue un secreto. Había dos escuelas construidas por los propios campesinos donde 180 niños recibían clases de cinco maestros de la comunidad que habían sido capacitados por el gobierno. Tienen cartas, algunas de la década del 90, donde solicitan a las autoridades nacionales y estatales audiencia para discutir la legalización de Centro Uno, como lo lograron unas pocas comunidades que se instalaron en el parque antes de la declaratoria de área protegida en 1990. Los de Centro Uno reunieron cartas oficiales de cinco alcaldes auxiliares de caseríos aledaños que dan fe de que los fundadores de Centro Uno, aun antes de nombrar la comunidad, vivían ahí mismo desde 1988.  —En fin –continúa Venustiano–, aquel día de 2009 nos dieron media hora para desalojar. Yo logré agarrar a mis cuatro niños. Dejé una prensa de maíz del ancho de dos metros cuadrados. Ya lo tenía en mi casa, y también 10 manzanas de pepitoria listas para cosechar. Todo el mundo perdió todo.  Estuardo Puga, el auxiliar de la PDDH a cargo de Petén que estuvo ahí, me confirmó que ese fue el tiempo que les dieron para desalojar, y que en camiones sacaron a las familias y las dejaron en Retalteco, un caserío a las afueras de La Libertad. Dijo que ellos se fueron a la 1:30 de la tarde, cuando terminó la diligencia, pero que se quedaron los militares y funcionarios del Conap. Dijo también que luego hubo denuncias de saqueo. Venustiano dice que se lo llevaron todo en unos camiones, que pasaron frente a ellos en Retalteco con sus novillos, sus sacos de cultivo, sus plantas eléctricas.  —Nos sacaron con el decir que nosotros somos narcotraficantes. Yo lo que veo es que es una excusa para las autoridades actuales, como para taparle el ojo al macho –dice Venustiano.  Le pregunto si alguien en la comunidad participaba en alguna actividad del narcotráfico.  —El narcotraficante vive en mansiones, no tiene necesidad de vivir en casitas de palma como vivíamos allá, y mucho menos en champas de nylon como vivimos ahora… ¿Quiere ver dónde vivimos los narcotraficantes de Centro Uno?  Tomamos un tuc tuc que nos saca del bullicio del mercado. Nos deja en una vereda de tierra por la que caminamos durante unos 15 minutos hasta llegar a una parcela.  —Entonces, ¿aquí es donde viven ustedes, los narcotraficantes?  —Aquí mismo, mire usté. Venga, le voy a presentar a toda la gente –me dice Venustiano.  Retira el alambre del palo y deja caer la portezuela.\n",

      "Más de 200 familias han sido evacuadas en el Valle de Sula, debido a las inundaciones provocadas por el desbordamiento del río Ulúa.  Autoridades de la Comisión Permanente de Contingencias (Copeco) se mantienen monitoreando el clima constantemente, debido a las lluvias que han caído en gran parte del territorio nacional, especialmente en la zona occidental.  Hasta ayer, Copeco manejaba que se había albergado a unas 277 familias en los municipios de Pimienta, San Manuel, Potrerillos y Villanueva, en el departamento de Cortés, así como en Santa Bárbara.  Las casas de estas personas se vieron afectadas por las llenas.  El titular nacional de Copeco, Moisés Alvarado, manifestó que los trabajos de monitoreo son constantes, pues se espera que las lluvias continúen para las próximas horas.  “Desde el pasado viernes se ha estado monitoreando la crecida del río Ulúa, pues las lluvias en el occidente no habían parado y eso provoca que el nivel aumente, pero afortunadamente ha disminuido el caudal”, recalcó Alvarado.  SIGUE ALERTA ROJA  Detalló que la Alerta Roja para el Valle de Sula se mantiene, pues depende de cómo vayan disminuyendo las lluvias.  “La Alerta Roja estaba para 72 horas (desde el sábado hasta hoy), pero esperamos que cambie o se mantenga, porque se esperan más lluvias, aunque con poco acumulados para el Valle de Sula”, dijo.  Ayer por la tarde, varios equipos de Copeco se desplazaron por diferentes albergues en Pimienta, Potrerillos y Villanueva, donde entregaron a los damnificados raciones de comida, kits de higiene, frazadas y duchas portátiles, entre otros implementos.  “Hasta el momento son 277 familias albergadas las que hay, aunque algunas permanecen en las casas de parientes, pero también se les está brindando apoyo por parte de la Copeco, pues se les llevó raciones de alimento, kits de higiene y otros implementos, con apoyo de la Cruz Roja”.  FAMILIA ATRAPADA      Por su parte, el subjefe noroccidental de Copeco, Rony Rodríguez, manifestó que en las colonias Policarpo Paz García, La Democracia y la Centroamericana de El Progreso, Yoro, también se reportaron inundaciones debido a las filtraciones en los bordos, por el alto nivel del río Ulúa.  “Hasta el momento, en estas colonias no se ha evacuado a ninguna familia, pero se está monitoreando que el nivel del río no aumente, porque se inundan con las filtraciones por los bordos de contención”, explicó Rodríguez.  Detalló que en San Manuel fueron evacuadas siete personas que residen en el alivio del río, por lo que reiteradamente están siendo rescatadas.  “Estas personas, hace siete días permanecieron albergadas; se hablará con el alcalde para tratar de buscar una solución, porque están en peligro sus vidas”.  Mientras que en Tencoa, Santa Bárbara, la crecida del río provocó inundaciones, por lo que una familia quedó atrapada en un islote, ya que al momento que el caudal se desbordaba, iban pasando por una calle.  “El Cuerpo de Bomberos rescató a una familia conformada por tres personas (la pareja y un bebé de 18 meses de nacido), pues quedó en un islote, al momento que el cauce se desbordó. De igual manera, se han dado pequeños derrumbes que no han causado daños mayores”, refirió.    \n",

      "This figure includes 242,000 IDPs who were displaced during the civil conflict. This specific number is based upon estimates published by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in 1997. Since then, updated figures on internal displacement have not been gathered at the country level.  The government pledged to address the specific needs and vulnerabilities of IDPs within its general anti-poverty interventions. However, at the end of 2007 the government had not agreed on criteria to include IDPs in a national reparation programme and it is unclear how many people can still be considered as displaced, if any.  The total figure, however, does not take into account organized groups of displaced people, nor it includes disaster-induced displacement figure, which as of December 2013 was of 93 IDPs who were displaced by an earthquake.  Displacement is a result of the conflict that opposed the government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity armed group. Between 1981 and 1983 when violence reached its most critical stage, the Guatemalan government launched operations tierra arrasada (“obliterated earth”), which meant to massacre entire communities in order to eliminate potential cooperation between the armed groups and their social base. As a consequence massive displacements occurred. The conflict towards 1997, after the signature of several peace agreements, and left between 500,000 and 1.5 million people displaced, most of them indigenous.  Many of the country’s IDPs have returned or resettled in areas where they live under similar conditions as before they were displaced. Many face extreme poverty and marginalisation.  In addition, there is evidence of new displacement caused by organized crime, street gangs and maras, as well as other territorial conflicts associated with illegal resources exploitation and land appropriation. Although there are no official figures about these new displacements, there is evidence of forced evictions carried out in 2011.  Furthermore, drug trafficking organisations and gangs seeking strategic territory in order to extract palm oil and smuggle merchandise through the border, forcibly displaced 470 families from Peten. In total, the press reported that 350 families have been displaced by violence.  IDMC uses only the most credible accurate information available. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it.\n",

      "3.6 million people affected. Over 45,000 houses damaged. Poorest are the worst hit.  North, central and coastal districts of Odisha are facing massive floods since August 5, 2014 due to the rise in the waters of the rivers Mahanadi, Baitarani, Budhabalanga, Subarnarekha and their tributaries. Release of excess water from dams in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh and incessant rains worsened the situation.  Worst hit:  Jajpur, Puri, Bhadhrak, Kendrapara and Cuttack.  Evacuations:  Government deployed 11 battalions of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and 30 battalions of Odisha State Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF). Rescue operations were completed on August 9, 2014.  Oxfam’s team carried out a rapid assessment in the worst affected Jajpur and Puri districts, where most of the villages are still submerged 15 ft deep, 8 out of 10 blocks in Jajpur and 6 out of 11 blocks in Puri district are still cut off and can be reached only via boats.  709,841 people displaced in Jajpur and 363,832 in Puri district.  Over 366,541 hectares of farm land is under water and the paddy crop has been destroyed.  Over 45,953 houses are damaged and will need reconstruction.  The floods have impacted 1.13 million livestock.  Families took shelter in school buildings, Panchayat Ghar (village meeting halls) and on higher grounds. Many are living on embankments in make shift shelters with their families and livestock. The food and financial security of the agrarian community has been impacted for a long term. With inadequate availability of drinking water supply, poor sanitation facilities and risky hygiene practices, there are high chances of worsening of water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) situation in the affected areas.  Disease:  Due to the lack of immediate healthcare, cases of diarrhea, fever, common cold, fungal infections are now being reported. There are many 0-5 year old children, lactating and pregnant women who need immediate medical attention.  Food security and nutrition:  Many from displaced communities are landless daily wage labourers with no work available at the moment. The Scheduled Caste (SC) communities in the affected villages are worst hit and have no access to food, livelihood, shelter and WaSH. They are relying 100% on government relief for food.  Poor Living Conditions:  Temporary shelters close to each other, people share this space on the embankment with their livestock. Some are living on road sides, high lands and on roof tops of concrete houses almost marooned in the flood waters. They are living in shelters made wood frames and tarpaulin.  Water and Sanitation:  The flood water has contaminated the tube wells, ponds and other water sources.  Schools:  Education of children from primary school is disrupted the buildings have been converted to a temporary relief shelter in Jajpur district. In Puri, school buildings are still submerged in flood water  Government Relief:  Food aid was available for ten days when 243 free community kitchens fed over 86,330 populations with cooked food. State government mobilized 77,856 quintals of rice, 5,221 quintals of flattened rice, 404 quintals of jiggery and 1,606 polythene rolls as emergency relief. Frontline health workers were mobilised by the health department to provide water disinfecting halogen tablets, ORS packets, anti-fungal and anti-diarrheal drugs. A government survey of damage of shelter and crop is yet to start.  Map of Assessed Areas      Dasarathpur block of Jajpur district was caught unawares, as this area is protected from flooding by the embankment. The people were not prepared for the flood, the first in 50 years, and therefore do not have sufficient coping mechanisms. Many have been displaced and are now housed in emergency shelters at schools and GP Offices. Many schools are non functional as many of them are being used as shelters while some are still submerged.  Dasratpur Block residents evacuated their villages and moved to embankments along with their livestock. All low-lying areas and crop fields of the assessed villages were submerged under water. Only means of access available to Rapid Assessment team were boats provided by the administration and NGOs. But the frequency of availability of boats within the villages is low, limiting the mobility of the community to access basic amenities at block level. The block administration has provided only one boat in Kanas block of Puri district and 21 boats in Jajpur district.  Most of the households do not have food grains and are dependent on relief received from government, which is minimal. A few local community leaders are providing some food aid. In few villages, local community based organisations are also supporting those affected with cooked food.\n",

      "Update 26 June 2014  The overall situation appears to have improved and the number of displaced has now dropped to 8,921.  A total of 33 villages are still affected, which is down from 43 yesterday. However the flooding has now spread to affect the district of Kamrup, as well as Lakhimpur, Sonitpur, Darrang and Udalguri.  River Levels  According to India’s Central Water Commission (CWC), the Brahmaputra at Neamatighat, the Jiabharali in Sonitpur district and the Beki in Barpeta district are flowing above the danger level.  Original Report 25 June 2014  Late June nearly always means floods in Assam, India. This year is no different, and Assam officials have reported that over 25,000 people have been affected by flooding over the last 2 days. Nearly 10,000 people have been displaced. Five relief camps in Darrang and Udalguri have been set up.  The flooding is a result of the monsoon rains in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The monsoon is said to be late arriving this year, with many forecasters predicting it to bring 5% less rainfall than average. Even so, levels of the Brahmaputra river at Numaligarh and Jia Bhoreli river in Sonitpur are dangerously high. Heavy rainfall in Arunachal Pradesh – situated in the mountainous region to the north – often means problems for Assam. In particular heavy rainfall there feeds the Jia Bhoreli (Kameng) and the Dibang and Lohit rivers, which are tributaries of the Brahmaputra river.  State Disaster Management Authority officials in Assam said that 9,528 people from around 43 separate villages in Assam have already left their homes to stay in relief camps and temporary accommodation after floods struck in four districts on Monday 23 June 2014. The four districts are Lakhimpur, Sonitpur, Darrang and Udalguri.\n",

      "Villagers with their belongings sit in a relief camp after their evacuation at Supaul district in Bihar August 3, 2014. REUTERS/Krishna Murari Kishan  BHUBANESHWAR(Thomson Reuters Foundation) - About 30,000 evacuated villagers in Bihar began returning home on Tuesday after the threat of floods due to a landslide in neighbouring Nepal eased, but 100,000 remained in relief camps, government officials said.  The landslide, triggered by heavy rains in Nepal's Sindhupalchowk district on Saturday, killed at least 33 people and created a mud dam blocking the Sunkoshi river, which flows into India as the Kosi river.  Indian authorities, fearing a torrent of water as the Nepalese army tried to clear the landslide, evacuated more than 130,000 villagers in Bihar over the weekend.  A senior disaster management official said the careful clearing of the landslide across the border had lessened the risk of flash floods and 30,000 evacuees were told to return home.  \"Some of the districts … in the downstream area such as Darbhanga, Madhubani, Khagaria and Bhagalpur, they may not face the problems anticipated earlier,\" said Vyasji, principal secretary of Bihar disaster management department.  \"We have stopped our evacuation process in these four districts. People who are at the relief camps have been told to go back to their villages,\" he told Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Patna, Bihar's main city.  But the districts of Supaul, Saharsa and Madhepura remained on high alert, Vyasji added, and around 100,000 people were still sheltering in relief camps.  Both India and Nepal have monitored the Kosi river closely since it broke its banks in 2008 and changed its course, killing more than 500 people, submerging swathes of land and affecting more than two million people in Bihar.  The Nepalese army has set off a series of controlled blasts over the past three days to drain the artificial lake slowly. Yadav Koirala, chief of the Natural Disaster Relief Division at the home ministry, said the army was trying to increase the river’s flow by draining the artificial lake formed by the landslide.  \"The army set off a small controlled explosion at the mud dam today to drain the lake. It is not a big blast,\" Koirala told Thomson Reuters Foundation. \"We are doing it very carefully so the water does not flow suddenly.  Monsoon rains that start in mid-June and continue through September are crucial for many countries in South Asia, but scores of people die every year in landslides and floods.  Heavy rains in June last year caused rivers and lakes to burst their banks, killing almost 6,000 people in the Indian state of Uttarakhand.

      "October 2014  Heavy and intense monsoon rain has devastated vulnerable communities across India as well as areas of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. We are asking for your help to provide urgent humanitarian support.  Homes swept away  At least 280 people died and around five million people were affected, following recent incessant rain in Jammu and Kashmir in northern India.  Raging floodwaters destroyed homes, sunk entire villages and deluged Srinagar city. More than 80% of areas in the city were underwater.  Our local partner Church Auxliary for Social Action (CASA) and Act Now for Harmony and Democracy (ANHAD) is responding now meeting the immediate needs for shelter, medical supplies and safe drinking water.  Our Regional Emergency Manager, Dipankar Patnaik said: ‘With winter fast approaching, this is an anxious time. It will soon be bitterly cold at night. Families have lost clothing and bedding. If people’s homes haven’t been totally destroyed, they are finding that they are simply too damaged or damp to live in. As ever, it’s the poorest and most marginalised who are hardest hit.’  Our partners have already distributed 4,000 blankets, 1,500 solar lanterns and 250 pressure cookers. With your support we could reach more of the worst affected.  Alongside providing vital food relief, our partners are ensuring clean drinking water by filtering polluted water sources and distributing water purification tablets.  ‘ Flooding on this scale is devastating. Communities in affected areas rely on farming to earn a living and feed themselves. For many that’s all gone. It’s an anxious and uncertain time.'  Thousands of desperate families  Food distribution in Odisha state run by our partner CASA  Since last July, torrential rain has caused severe flooding and affected 3.6 million people in Odisha state, eastern India.  Though water is abundant, it is dangerous to drink. CASA is providing community kitchens, filtering water from open wells and distributing vital water purification tablets.  We will be meeting the desperate need for shelter aiming to reach 650 households with tarpaulins, ground sheets and mosquito nets.  We also aim to support 500 households with cash-for-work, a much needed source of income in the aftermath of an emergency.  Serving the community  Our Regional Emergency Manager, Dipankar Patnaik said: ‘Flooding on this scale is devastating. Communities in affected areas rely on farming to earn a living and feed themselves. For many that’s all gone. It’s an anxious and uncertain time.  ‘In an effort to make ends meet, households are often forced to sell whatever might be left of their belongings and slide deeper into debt. With no savings to fall back on, cash-for-work is vital.’  Those involved help clear debris and repair people’s homes. It provides a much needed income for the most vulnerable while serving the community.  Homeless villagers in Uttar Pradesh  More than 1 million people were affected by flooding in Uttar Pradesh.  Around 1,100 villages were flooded, forcing families to seek refuge on nearby embankments and along the national highway.  Our partners, including Poorvanchal Gramin Vikas Sansathan (PGVS), are responding, aiming to reach 5,500 people with essential relief items including food, tarpaulins, mosquito nets, buckets and soap.\n",

      "Nearly 1.2 millio­n people are now stayin­g in around 1,600 relief camps opened in school­s and govern­ment office­s  KOLKATA: Floods from days of torrential rain have now claimed at least 180 lives in India with one million people sheltering in relief camps after fleeing surging waters, officials said Tuesday.  Rivers have burst their banks, hitting thousands of villages in parts of West Bengal as well as northeastern Manipur state, where roads and bridges have been cut and communications were patchy.  Most of those 180 died from drowning, while at least four people have been killed in a landslide that buried a remote village in Manipur bordering Myanmar, where heavy monsoon rains have also wreaked havoc.  The death toll jumped from around 120 on Monday, after the discovery of more bodies in West Bengal and the western state of Gujarat where water levels have receded, allowing families to return home.  “The death toll due to flooding in West Bengal rose to 70, with roads and farms in 13,200 villages remaining under water,” disaster management minister Javed Ahmad Khan told AFP.  “Nearly 1.2 million people are now staying in around 1,600 relief camps opened in schools and government offices,” he said.  The release of water from brimming dams has exacerbated the flooding in West Bengal after Cyclone Komen struck the east coast on Friday, Khan said.  “Rivers in 13 districts are flowing over their danger marks. The situation is grim.”  Another five people have died in Orissa and 35 in northern Rajasthan state, officials there said.  “The worst is over. Now we are focusing on relief and rehabilitation of affected people,” Rajasthan’s disaster minister, Gulab Singh Kataria, told AFP.  In Manipur, television footage showed villagers erecting a bamboo bridge over a muddy river after flood waters left them stranded, and a child trying to cross by floating in a rubber tyre.  Rescuers were still searching for villagers feared buried in a landslide that struck their hamlet on Saturday, with four bodies found, Jason Shimray, an official overseeing the rescue operation, said.  Shimray said 10 people feared killed in the landslide have been found alive, although details were sketchy.  In the western state of Gujarat, flooding has eased in recent days, but the death toll has reached 72 after the discovery of more bodies, director of relief operations Bipin Bhatt told AFP.  India, which receives nearly 80 per cent of its annual rainfall from June to September, sees tragedy strike every monsoon season.  Read full story\n",

      "PATNA, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Authorities were rushing food rations, clothes and cooking utensils to villagers in Bihar on Thursday after a storm killed at least 48 people and left thousands more homeless, government officials said.  With wind speeds of up to 70 km per hour (43 mph) and heavy rains, the storm struck the eastern state late on Tuesday, uprooting trees and electricity poles, ripping through farmland and destroying over 25,000 mud-and-thatch homes.  State officials said 12 of Bihar's 38 districts had been affected, including Purnia, Madhepura and Saharsa.  \"Now we are rushing relief, food items and utensils to the affected families,\" Anirudh Kumar, a state disaster management official, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  As well as ripping apart homes and destroying possessions, the storm also flattened banana plantations and maize and wheat fields, causing many villagers to lose their livelihoods, he said.  Officials said they were still assessing the scale of the devastation, a process hindered by snapped telecommunication lines and villages cut off by uprooted trees blocking roads.  \"The damage is huge although we cannot provide the exact figure because we are still assessing the extent of damage,\" said Sudhir Kumar, a senior official in Purnia.  Bihar's governor Keshari Nath Tripathi has asked the state government to provide 400,000 rupees ($6,300) in compensation to each of the victims' families.  Weather officials said because the storm developed quickly, there was not enough time to issue an early warning and evacuate villagers to shelters.  India is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, and many of its 1.2 billion people live in areas vulnerable to natural hazards such as floods, cyclones, droughts and earthquakes.  In 2008, major flooding in Bihar triggered by heavy monsoons left more than 500 people dead and disrupted the lives of two million others.  (Writing by Nita Bhalla; Editing by Katie Nguyen)\n",

      "RAIPUR: With one more person being washed away in an overflowing drain in Janjgir district on Wednesday, the death toll in the raging floods in Chhattisgarh reached three. As nearly 700 villages remain marooned in the districts of Gariyaband, Mahasamund, Kanker, Bastar, Janjgir, and Bemetara, evacuations have been carried out in several low lying areas to ensure the safety of the people.While there has been some respite from the rains in the past 24 hours, the over 350 mm of rains in two days (Monday and Tuesday) has caused havoc in the affected districts. Majority of the rivers in the state - Sodur, Pari, Jonk, Tale, Indravati, Mahanadi, Shivnath and Doodh - continue to be in spate with waters flowing above the danger marks. Water level in most of the dams in the state continues to be at critical levels.In Janjgir district, nearly 200 people have been evacuated from Shivrinarian and Chandrapur areas and shifted to community centres, as water from the Mahanadi River inundated their homes. According to district collector, OP Choudhary, the administration is on a high alert as water level in Mahanadi was at least five feet above the danger mark.Choudhary said connectivity of several inundated villages had been cut off to Raigarh and Sarangarh. He said due to blockage in Shivrinarain Sabri Setu, connectivity between Raipur and Balodabazar was also cut off.The collector confirmed the death of a middle-aged man, who was washed away in the Dhanuar Nala. Water had entered several localities and even the hospital and the bus stand near the Nagar Panchayat at Shivrinarain area was flooded.In Bemetara district release of over 80,000 cusecs of water from the Mogra dam in Rajnandgaon resulted in flooding of several low-lying areas in the district. Collector, B Raju, told TOI that water was flowing over 4 feet above the danger mark at Simga bridge. He said several parts of the districts were cut off from from Raipur and Jabalpur due to flooded roads.He said the water level in Shivnath river water was still above the danger mark.With not much rains in the past 24 hours, the situation in the other affected districts of Gariyaband, Mahasamund, Kanker and Bastar remained under control. Though hundreds of villages still remain marooned, the respite from rains has prevented the situation from going from bad to worse.According to officials these districts still remain on an alert and efforts were on to move people from low-lying areas to safer locations.While the state has so far recorded 516.7 MM of rains since June 1, over 444 mm of downpour has been received in the past 72 hours. The met department forecasting light to moderate rains at few places in the state due to monsoon trough.\n",

      "Kohima: The Nagaland Unit of BJP has strongly urged the State Government to take immediate and appropriate steps to contain the Tuensang ‘tribal issue’ before the situation goes out of hand.  A party statement here said, in an emergency meeting held on Sunday, the BJP Nagaland stated that it has the ‘first-hand experience on how the people of Tuensang are suffering in the wake of the inter tribal violence.’  It urged the state government to depute the respective elected members to try and solve the issue amicably as soon as possible and condemned the sorry state of affairs and the deteriorating law and order situation.  “The Chief Minister and the Home Minister have to own the responsibility and act before it turned worse and may cause immense harm to the State as a whole,” it stated.  The BJP brought to fore the need for an inter tribe consultation in this regard. The involvement of various Hohos and civil organisations is required to stop the present existing tension in the area, it maintained.  “At least 1000 people or more of one particular tribe have left to the district headquarters from Tuensang due to the tension still existing in the area. Such a huge exodus of people from a population of about 5,000 to 6,000 in Tuensang town has serious repercussion and implication in various fields,” it said.  The interests and aspirations of a particular tribe in a constituency has been hampered,” it said. (UNI)\n",

      "Troops deployed as tribal rampage leaves 32 dead in northeastern India  Updated  India has deployed troops to the state of Assam on Saturday after at least 32 were killed following days of deadly tribal violence in the northeastern state of Assam.  Soldiers in convoys of trucks mounted with rifles are patrolling in Baksa district, where some of the attacks took place.  The violence erupted on Thursday after tribal rebels killed three villagers in Baksa district and eight more in neighbouring Kokrahjar.  The rebels opened fire on the victims as they slept in their homes.  Similar violence, also perpetrated by the tribal rebels, 12 muslims dead on Friday  Police have found nine more bodies, including those of women and children, from Narayanguri village in Baksa district, 200 kilometres from Assam's main city of Guwahati.  Authorities say all the victims were Muslim migrants who have been locked in land disputes with indigenous Bodo tribes in the state, which shares borders with Bangladesh and Bhutan.  Local police said the attacks have forced 5,000 people to flee from their homes.  The violence has also prompted a massive manhunt for the rebels, with police accusing the outlawed National Democratic Front of Bodoland, which has been fighting for a separate homeland, for the attacks.  \"Security has been further tightened with police and paramilitary troopers deployed in strength,\" said police Inspector General S. N. Singh.  Inspector Singh said an indefinite curfew has been imposed the affected districts, with police being given shoot-on-sight orders.  On Sunday, Muslims in Baksa were refusing to bury 18 of those killed, in a protest against authorities whom they blame for failing to protect them.  \"Right now we are sitting in the open with 18 bodies in front of us,\" said Lafiqul Islam, president of the All Bengali Muslim Students Union.  \"We will continue with our protest and not perform the funeral until and unless the chief minister personally visits the spot.\"  The attacks have occurred in the midst of the Indian general elections, which began on April 7 and expected to end on May 12.  In 2012, ethnic clashes in the same area killed around 100 people and displaced more than 400,000.  AFP/Reuters  Topics: unrest-conflict-and-war, india  First posted\n",

      "Image copyright AP Image caption Both India and Pakistan have accused each other of starting the latest hostilities  Thousands of villagers have fled their homes in Indian-administered Kashmir as Indian and Pakistani troops continue to exchange fire in the region.  At least 10 Indian and Pakistani soldiers and civilians have been killed in the violence over the past week.  Both sides have accused each other of starting the hostilities.  A ceasefire agreed in 2003 remains in place, but the neighbours often accuse each other of violating it.  The latest round of hostilities come days before US Secretary of State John Kerry is due to visit India. President Barack Obama is also due to visit India as the chief guest at the country's Republic Day celebrations on 26 January.  Some 10,000 civilians living in border villages on the Indian side have fled their homes since fighting began last week, a senior official named Shantmanu told Reuters news agency.  \"We had a narrow escape and there is a war-like situation,\" Sham Kumar, 54, an affected villager said.  \"Pakistani troops are using long-range weapons. It is the first time we have seen such intense shelling.\"  He said he had left his village after a shell landed in a school about 3.5km (2 miles) from the border.  India and Pakistan are continuing to exchange fire in the disputed region on Tuesday, reports say.  Image copyright EPA Image caption Hostilities between the neighbours have escalated in the past year  \"The firing is going on and we are giving befitting reply to Pakistani shelling,\" an Indian official said.  Pakistan said on Monday that its soldiers were \"effectively responding to India's [unprovoked] firing\".  A Pakistani military statement said four civilians, including a woman and a teenage boy, had been killed by Indian fire near the city of Sialkot since Sunday.  India said one of its soldiers was killed by Pakistani fire in the Samba area on Monday.  Last week, Indian forces in Kashmir killed four Pakistani troops on the border after an Indian soldier was killed in an attack blamed on Pakistan. Pakistan said it had lodged a protest with the Indian high commissioner in Islamabad.  Hostilities between the neighbours have escalated in the past year.  In October, 16 people - nine Pakistanis and seven Indians - died when the two sides exchanged fire for several days.  Correspondents say 2014 saw an escalation in hostilities between the neighbours, with some of the worst violence in a decade. Both sides have accused each other of initiating the clashes.  Earlier in the summer, India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif to his inauguration and there were hopes that relations between Delhi and Islamabad would improve.  But relations have deteriorated since then, with India cancelling scheduled talks with Pakistan in August and insisting that Delhi would \"not tolerate acts of border violations by Pakistan\" and that \"ceasefire violations must stop\".  Kashmir, claimed by both countries in its entirety, has been a flashpoint for more than 60 years and the South Asian rivals have fought two wars over the region.\n",

      "Some 20,000 Indians have fled to relief camps while at least 2,000 Pakistanis have sought shelter with relatives, or in open fields  By Fayaz Bukhari and Katharine Houreld  P.S. PORA, India/SIALKOT, Pakistan, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - It was a balmy night when mortar struck the courtyard of Shahdin Mohammad's home, killing his son and grandson and injuring three other family members who were asleep outside.  He knelt on the ground, cradling his 12-year-old grandson, shouting for help, but by the time a neighbour arrived and drove them to the nearest clinic, it was too late.  \"The firing started at 2 a.m. and we had nowhere to go. We were outside our home and a shell landed right in front of us,\" said Mohammad, a 65-year-old Indian farmer from Jeora Farm village. \"That was the end of the world for me.\"  Located about one kilometre (0.62 mile) from India's border with Pakistan, Jeora Farm is one of scores of villages in the disputed Kashmir region being hit by increasing exchange of fire between the two nations.  During an 11 year lull in fighting along this stretch of the border after a 2003 ceasefire, villages grew on both sides, with brick buildings replacing mud huts and schools and wedding halls opening close to check-points but that peace is now shattered.  In August when Mohammad's family was killed, the firing went on for 45 days, affecting rice production and schooling for many children. This month has seen a renewed bout of fighting.  The firing, usually restricted to military posts, has killed 23 civilians this year, the highest death toll in over a decade, and prompted accusations of the deliberate targeting civilians.  This month nine Pakistanis and eight Indians were killed in the latest spat between the South Asian nuclear-armed neighbours.  Amid the fighting some 20,000 Indians have fled to relief camps while at least 2,000 Pakistanis have sought shelter with relatives, or in open fields, out of the range of fire.  \"There is good reason for concern,\" said Michael Kugelman, Senior Program Associate for South and Southeast Asia at the Woodrow Wilson International Institute for Scholars.  \"Not only are we seeing more civilian casualties than is typically the case, but we're also seeing cases of children wounded and killed by shelling ... It's expanded into a humanitarian tragedy.\"  DELIBERATE TARGETS  India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947, two of them over the mostly-Muslim region of Kashmir with its Himalayan mountains and fertile valleys which they both claim in full but rule in part.  Although the tit-for-tat artillery fire frequently rattles the so-called Line of Control (LoC), separating Indian- and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, the clashes have intensified.  Indian military officials say there have been over 110 ceasefire violations by Pakistan so far this year compared to 347 in 2013 and 114 in 2012.  Islamabad says there have been 227 violations by New Delhi this year, against 414 in 2013 and 230 the year before.  But Chief Minister of Indian-administered Kashmir has accused Pakistan of a change in tactic and targeting civilians.  \"Such a large scale loss to the civilians clearly indicates they have changed their strategy from engaging in cross-firing with the forces on this side of border to specifically targeting the civilian areas,\" Omar Abdullah told journalists this week.  Pakistani military officials deny the claim.  Major General Khan Tahir Javed Khan said the Pakistani army only fires mortars back and never at civilians.  He claimed India has fired 19,733 mortars into his 193 km (120 mile) stretch of the disputed border so far this year, compared to 180 in 2012.  \"Our main fire is concentrated onto their posts, not onto their villages,\" Khan insisted.  One mortar hit Irum Shahzadi's home in the Pakistani village of Dhamala early Monday as her three sons leapt out of bed, excited about celebrating the Muslim holiday of Eid.  \"I could not see anything, because of the dark (smoke), so I started groping on the floor. I found my younger son, and lifted him into my lap,\" said Shahzadi, weeping uncontrollably.  \"My entire world has collapsed ... My sons ... one had no face, the other was hit in the chest and in the arms.\"  Two of the boys died.  IN THE LINE OF FIRE  In the lush Basmati rice-growing plains of India's R.S. Pora sector, the skirmishes temporarily displace thousands of people who move into schools turned into relief camps and this can disrupt the lives of everyone from children to farmers.  \"First, it was dry weather that affected our crops. Then when it rained, the firing drove us away from the village,\" said Vicky Kumar, a farmer in Abdullain village on the Indian side.  \"We couldn't apply fertilisers and this led to the crop failing. We expect only 50 percent yield this year.\"  Children complain of not being able to go to school, saying even when the guns fall silent, they are too scared to go out.  But the biggest challenge facing villagers in this stretch of border comes at night when the mortars fall.  In the Pakistani village of Dhamala, Wazir Bibi said she and her four daughters were always scared but couldn't leave.  \"Every time I hear the blasts, if feels like my heart will burst from my body,\" said Bibi, 65. \"We are women and poor, we cannot sleep in the fields, we have nowhere to go.\"  \"HELL'S VILLAGE\"  However some villagers living along border said they had benefited from 2003 ceasefire agreement.  In the Indian town of Arnia, people farm their land right up to the international border and have turned their mud houses into two-storey structures with satellite dishes and bathrooms.  Residents proudly point to a wedding hall as a sign of normality, saying previously few marriages occurred here as families refused to marry their daughters to young men living in a place once nicknamed \"Hell's village\".  Shops sell cement and floor tiles to feed a construction boom and a 30 km stretch of road from Jammu town to the border crossing of Suchetgarh is being widened to four lanes.  The plan was to eventually open the area for trade between the two nations, but that seems a distant reality now.  Islamabad and New Delhi blame one another for initiating the border shelling, both saying that they will not back down first.  Pakistan on Thursday said it was capable of responding \"befittingly\" to India, while India said Pakistan would pay an \"unaffordable price\" if it persisted with the shelling.  The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday expressed concern over deaths and displacement of civilians, while human rights groups have warned of the violatation of international humanitarian laws if claims of targeting civilians are true.  \"They should investigate any allegations of violations including the indiscriminate use of weapons such as heavy artillery in densely populated areas, using civilians as human shields, or otherwise placing them at unnecessary risk,\" said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director for Human Rights Watch.
