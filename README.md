# Internal Displacement

**Slack Channel:** [#internal-displacement](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/internal-displacement/)

**Project Description:**  Classifying, tagging, analyzing and visualizing news articles about [internal displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person). Based on a [challenge from the IDMC](https://unite.un.org/ideas/content/idetect). Our aim is to build a tool that can populate a database with displacement events from online news articles, which can be both classified by a machine, and then verified and analyzed by a human. 

We are using a Python back end to scrape, tag, classify and extract information from articles, which will be wrapped in a pretty UI, so that an analyst can interact with the data.

## Getting started:

1. Join the [Slack channel]((https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/internal-displacement/)).
2. Read the rest of this page and the [IDETECT challenge page](https://unite.un.org/ideas/content/idetect) to understand the project.
* We use [issues](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/internal-displacement/issues) (small tasks) and [milestones](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/internal-displacement/milestones) (bigger objectives) to guide the project. Browse them to find where you can help. Keep an eye out for `help-wanted`, `beginner-friendly`, and `discussion` tags. 
* See something you want to work on? Before you start on it, make a comment under the issue or ping us on Slack so we can assign you the task or discuss it.
* Before writing any code, make sure you've read the [steps for contributing to a D4D project on GitHub](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/github-playground).
* Write your code and submit a pull request to add it to the project. Reach out for help any time!

### Things you should know

* **Beginners are welcome!** We're happy to help you get started. *(For beginners with Git and GitHub specifically, our [github-playground](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/github-playground) repo and the [#github-help](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/github-help/) Slack channel are good places to start.)*
* **We believe good code is reviewed code.** All commits to this repository are approved by project maintainers and/or leads (listed above). The goal here is *not* to criticize or judge your abilities! Rather, sharing insights and achievements. Code reviews help us continually refine the project's scope and direction, and encourage discussion.
* **This README belongs to everyone.** If we've missed some crucial information or left anything unclear, edit this document and submit a pull request. We welcome the feedback! Up-to-date documentation is critical to what we do, and changes like this are a great way to make your first contribution to the project.

## Project Overview and Progress

The final aim is to create a user friendly app that can take in many URLs that link to news articles and return a database populated with a row for each article that includes:

- URL
- Number of times URL has been submitted
- Main text
- Source (eg. new york times)
- Publication date
- Title
- Author(s)
- Language of article
- Reason for displacement (violence/disaster/both/other)
- The location where the displacement happened
- Reporting term: displaced/evacuated/forced to fee/homeless/in relief camp/sheltered/relocated/destroyed housing/partially destroyed housing/uninhabitable housing
- Reporting unit: people/persons/individuals/children/inhabitants/residents/migrants or families/households/houses/homes
- Number displaced
- Metrics relating to machine learning accuracy and reliability

This information can then be used to analyse the flow of internally displaced people, details about reporting and to improve the classification and NLP elements of the program.

### Project Components

These are the main parts and functions that make up the project.

* **Scraper and Pipeline**
 * Take lists of URLs as input from [input dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c2vzdzrljlrn3y0/idmc_uniteideas_input_url.csv?dl=0)
 * Filter irrelevant articles and types of content (videos etc.)
 * Scrape the main body text and metadata (publish date, language etc.)
 * Store the information in a database
* **Interpreter**
 * Classify URLs as *conflict/violence*, *disaster* or *other*. There is a [training dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/50sgd3mztuhf5f6/training_dataset.csv?dl=0) to help with tagging.
 * Extract information from articles: location and number of reporting units (households or individuals) displaced, date published and reporting term (conflict/violence, disaster or other). The larger [extended input dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2qt52uy1g3ci4rr/idmc_uniteideas_input_full.csv?dl=0) and the text from articles we have already scraped can be used to help here.
* **Visualizer**
 * A mapping tool to visualize the displacement figures and locations, identify hotspots and trends.
 * Other visualizations for a selected region to identify reporting frequency on the area
 * Visualizing the excerpts of documents where the relevant information is reported (either looking at the map or browsing the list of URLs).
 * Visualise relability of classification and information extraction algorithms (either overall or by article)
 * Some pre-tagged datasets ([1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p42dq6gxvdugo3d/counts_displaced_idmc_uniteideas_input_full_conflict_tag.csv?dl=0), [2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0h71jlfc5tmm7bk/counts_evacuation_idmc_uniteideas_input_full_conflict_tag.csv?dl=0)) can be used to start exploring visualization options.
* **App** [separate repository for web framework](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/internal-displacement-web)
 * A non-technical-user friendly front end to wrap around the components above for inputting URLs, managing the databases, verifying data and interacting with visualisations
 * Automation of scraping, pipeline and interpreter

### Running in Docker

You can run everything as you're accustomed to by installing dependencies locally, but
another option is to run in a Docker container. That way, all of the dependencies will
be installed in a controlled, reproducible way.

1. Install Docker: https://www.docker.com/products/overview
2. Build the docker container (unfortunately, this will take a while the first time):

```
docker build -t internal-displacement .
```
You'll need to do this again if you want to install python dependencies by adding them to `requirements.txt`,
but it should be faster on subsequent runs.

3. Run the container. By default, this starts a jupyter notebook server (change the first 8888 to another port, if you're already running something there):

```
docker run -it --rm --env-file docker.env -p 8888:8888 -v $PWD:/project internal-displacement
```
 - `-it` set up the terminal to run interactively
 - `--rm` remove the container when it's finished
 - `--env-file docker.env` set up environment variables from this file (notably, tells it where the DB is)
 - `-p 8888:8888` map http://localhost:8888 to the jupyter server running on port 8888 inside the docker container
 - `-v $PWD:/project` map the current directory into the docker container so that changes you make inside the container
 also appear out here
    
4. You can also run the unit tests with:

```
docker run --rm --env-file docker.env -v $PWD:/project internal-displacement nosetests
```

So far we have used **Python 3** for the internal engine of our application. 

We currently need people with skills in:

- **JavaScript/HTML/css** (making the UI)
- **Web frameworks - (django/nodejs, weâ€™re undecided)** - (building the application)
- **AWS or other devops** - (automating and infrastructure)
- **Visualisation** - (visualise internal displacement crises and machine learning reliability)

### Tips for working on this project

- Try to keep each contribution and pull request focussed mostly on solving the issue at hand. If you see more things that are needed, feel free to let us know and/or make another issue.
- Datasets can be accessed from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/59lyts9d4ar1jcc/AADMyxDSQC_NGbpaPiuDGJ2ha?dl=0)
